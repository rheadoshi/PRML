( train_bengalifemale_00928 " But our families may not exactly reciprocate the same level of friendship " )
( train_bengalifemale_00929 " So let us stay apart and meet often as friends and even may go for killing together " )
( train_bengalifemale_00930 " But it is better if our family stays apart from yours " )
( train_bengalifemale_00931 " The lion agreed to this and the two families parted as friends and the jackal and the lion were still close friends and used to go for kills together " )

( train_bengalifemale_00990 " There is no other way for me to go home " )
( train_bengalifemale_00991 " Open your mouth wide so I can jump right into it " )
( train_bengalifemale_00992 " While the crocodile lay on the rock with his mouth wide open and his eyes shut the monkey jumped " )
( train_bengalifemale_00993 " As before he whisked into his tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_00994 " The crocodile saw the trick the monkey had played on him and admired him " )
( train_bengalifemale_00995 " He said monkey you have great cunning mind You have no fear I will let you alone after this " )
( train_bengalifemale_00996 " Thank you crocodile but I shall be on the watch for you just the same said the monkey " )

( train_bengalifemale_01008 " Bake it in hot coals said another " )
( train_bengalifemale_01009 " So one plan after another was spoken of " )
( train_bengalifemale_01010 " Then an old man who had always been afraid of the water said Throw the thing into the lake where it flows out over the rocks into the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_01011 " Then it will surely be killed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01012 " When the turtle heard what the old man said he thrust out his head and asked Friend what have I done that you should do such a dreadful thing as that to me " )
( train_bengalifemale_01013 " The other plans were bad enough but to throw me into the lake do not speak of such a cruel thing " )
( train_bengalifemale_01014 " When the king heard what the turtle said he told his men to take the turtle at once and throw it into the lake " )
( train_bengalifemale_01015 " The turtle laughed to himself as he slid away down the river to his old home " )

( train_bengalifemale_01020 " Each man went up and down the streets he had chosen calling Tinware for sale Brass for sale " )
( train_bengalifemale_01021 " People came out to their door steps and bought or traded with them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01022 " In one house there lived a poor old woman and her granddaughter " )
( train_bengalifemale_01023 " The family had once been rich but now the only thing they had left of all their riches was a golden bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_01024 " The grandmother did not know it was a golden bowl but she had kept this because her husband used to eat out of it in the old days " )
( train_bengalifemale_01025 " It stood on a shelf among the other pots and pans and was not often used " )
( train_bengalifemale_01026 " The greedy merchant passed this house calling Buy my water jars Buy my pans " )
( train_bengalifemale_01027 " The granddaughter said Oh Grandmother do buy something for me " )
( train_bengalifemale_01028 " My dear said the old woman we are too poor to buy anything I have not anything to trade even " )
( train_bengalifemale_01029 " Grandmother see what the merchant will give for the old bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_01030 " We do not use that and perhaps he will take it and give us something we want for it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01031 " The greedy man took the bowl and scratched its side with a needle " )
( train_bengalifemale_01032 " He hoped he could get it for nothing so he said What is this worth Not even a halfpenny " )
( train_bengalifemale_01033 " He threw the bowl on the ground and went away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01034 " By and by the other merchant passed the house " )
( train_bengalifemale_01035 " For it was agreed that either merchant might go through any street which the other had left " )
( train_bengalifemale_01036 " He called Buy my water jars Buy my tin ware Buy my brass " )
( train_bengalifemale_01037 " The little girl heard him and begged her grandmother to see what he would give for the bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_01038 " My child said the grandmother the merchant who was just here threw the bowl on the ground and went away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01039 " I have nothing else to offer in trade " )
( train_bengalifemale_01040 " But Grandmother said the girl that was a cross man This one looks pleasant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01041 " Ask him Perhaps he will give some little tin dish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01042 " Call him then and show it to him said the old woman " )
( train_bengalifemale_01043 " As soon as the merchant took the bowl in his hands he knew it was of gold " )
( train_bengalifemale_01044 " He said All that I have here is not worth so much as this bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_01045 " It is a golden bowl I am not rich enough to buy it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01046 " But sir a merchant who passed here a few moments ago threw it on the ground saying it was not worth a halfpenny and he went away said the grandmother " )
( train_bengalifemale_01047 " It was worth nothing to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01048 " If you value it take it giving the little girl some dish she likes for it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01049 " But the merchant would not have it so " )
( train_bengalifemale_01050 " He gave the woman all the money he had and all his wares " )
( train_bengalifemale_01051 " Give me but eight pennies he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01052 " So he took the pennies and left " )
( train_bengalifemale_01053 " Going quickly to the river he paid the boatman the eight pennies to take him across the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_01054 " Soon the greedy merchant went back to the house where he had seen the golden bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_01055 " Bring that bowl to me and I will give you something for it he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01056 " No said the grandmother You said the bowl was worthless but another merchant has paid a great price for it and taken it away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01057 " Then the greedy merchant was angry crying out Through this other man I have lost a small fortune That bowl was of gold " )
( train_bengalifemale_01058 " He ran down to the riverside and seeing the other merchant in the boat out in the river he called Hello Boatman Stop your boat " )
( train_bengalifemale_01059 " But the man in the boat said do not stop " )
( train_bengalifemale_01060 " So he reached the city on the other side of the river and lived well for a time on the money the bowl brought him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01061 " A turtle lived in a pond at the foot of a hill " )
( train_bengalifemale_01062 " Two young wild Geese looking for food saw the turtle and talked with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01063 " The next day the Geese came again to visit the turtle and they became very well acquainted Soon they were great friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_01064 " Friend turtle the Geese said one day we have a beautiful home far away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01065 " We are going to fly back to it tomorrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_01066 " It will be a long but pleasant journey Will you go with us " )
( train_bengalifemale_01067 " How could I I have no wings said the turtle " )
( train_bengalifemale_01068 " Oh we will take you if only you can keep your mouth shut and say not a word to anybody they said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01069 " I can do that said the turtle Do take me with you I will do exactly as you wish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01070 " So the next day the Geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01071 " Now take the middle of this in your mouth and do not say a word until we reach home they said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01072 " The Geese then sprang into the air with the turtle between them holding fast to the stick " )
( train_bengalifemale_01073 " The village children saw the two Geese flying along with the turtle and cried out Oh see the turtle up in the air " )
( train_bengalifemale_01074 " Look at the Geese carrying a turtle by a stick Did you ever see anything more ridiculous in your life " )
( train_bengalifemale_01075 " The turtle looked down and began to say Well and if my friends carry me what business is that of yours when he let go and fell dead at the feet of the children " )
( train_bengalifemale_01076 " As the two Geese flew on they heard the people say when they came to see the poor turtle That fellow could not keep his mouth shut " )
( train_bengalifemale_01077 " He had to talk and so lost his life " )
( train_bengalifemale_01078 " Long ago a man owned a very strong Ox " )
( train_bengalifemale_01079 " The owner was so proud of his Ox that he boasted to every man he met about how strong his Ox was " )
( train_bengalifemale_01080 " One day the owner went into a village and said to the men there as this " )
( train_bengalifemale_01081 " I will pay a forfeit of a thousand pieces of silver if my strong Ox cannot draw a line of one hundred wagons " )
( train_bengalifemale_01082 " The men laughed and said Very well; bring your Ox and we will tie a hundred wagons in a line and see your Ox draw them along " )
( train_bengalifemale_01083 " So the man brought his Ox into the village " )
( train_bengalifemale_01084 " A crowd gathered to see the sight " )
( train_bengalifemale_01085 " The hundred carts were in line and the strong Ox was yoked to the first wagon " )
( train_bengalifemale_01086 " Then the owner whipped his Ox " )
( train_bengalifemale_01087 " But the Ox had never been talked to in that way and he stood still " )
( train_bengalifemale_01088 " Neither the blows nor the hard names could make him move " )
( train_bengalifemale_01089 " At last the poor man paid his forfeit and went sadly home " )
( train_bengalifemale_01090 " There he threw himself on his bed and cried Why did that strong Ox act so " )
( train_bengalifemale_01091 " Many a time he has moved heavier loads easily " )
( train_bengalifemale_01092 " Why did he shame me before all those people " )
( train_bengalifemale_01093 " At last he got up and went about his work " )
( train_bengalifemale_01094 " When he went to feed the Ox that night the Ox turned to him and said Why did you whip me today " )
( train_bengalifemale_01095 " You never whipped me before You never called me hard names before " )
( train_bengalifemale_01096 " Then the man said I will never treat you badly again " )
( train_bengalifemale_01097 " I am sorry I whipped you and called you with bad names " )
( train_bengalifemale_01098 " I will never do so any more Forgive me Very well said the Ox " )
( train_bengalifemale_01099 " Tomorrow I will go into the village and draw the one hundred carts for you " )
( train_bengalifemale_01100 " You have always been a kind master until today " )
( train_bengalifemale_01101 " Tomorrow you shall gain what you lost " )
( train_bengalifemale_01102 " The next morning the owner fed the Ox well and hung a garland of flowers about his neck " )
( train_bengalifemale_01103 " When they went into the village the men laughed at the man again " )
( train_bengalifemale_01104 " They said Did you come back to lose more money " )
( train_bengalifemale_01105 " Today I will pay a forfeit of two thousand pieces of silver if my Ox is not strong enough to pull the one hundred carts said the owner " )
( train_bengalifemale_01106 " So again the carts were placed in a line and the Ox was yoked to the first " )
( train_bengalifemale_01107 " A crowd came to watch again " )
( train_bengalifemale_01108 " And he patted his neck and stroked his sides " )
( train_bengalifemale_01109 " At once the Ox pulled with all his strength " )
( train_bengalifemale_01110 " The carts moved on until the last cart stood where the first had been " )
( train_bengalifemale_01111 " Then the crowd shouted and they paid back the forfeit the man had lost saying Your Ox is the strongest Ox we ever saw " )
( train_bengalifemale_01112 " And the Ox and the man went home happy " )
( train_bengalifemale_01113 " Once upon a time a merchant with his goods packed in many carts came to a desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_01114 " He was on his way to the country on the other side of the desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_01115 " The sun shone on the fine sand making it as hot as the top of a stove " )
( train_bengalifemale_01116 " No man could walk on it in the sunlight " )
( train_bengalifemale_01117 " But at night after the sun went down the sand cooled and then men could travel upon it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01118 " So the merchant waited until after dark and then set out " )
( train_bengalifemale_01119 " All night long he and his men rode on and on One man was the pilot " )
( train_bengalifemale_01120 " He rode first for he knew the stars and by them he guided the drivers " )
( train_bengalifemale_01121 " At daybreak they stopped and camped " )
( train_bengalifemale_01122 " They unyoked the oxen and fed them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01123 " They built fires and cooked the rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01124 " Then they spread a great awning over all the carts and the oxen and the men lay down under it to rest until sunset " )
( train_bengalifemale_01125 " In the early evening they again built fires and cooked rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01126 " After supper they folded the awning and put it away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01127 " They yoked the oxen and as soon as the sand was cool they started again on their journey across the desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_01128 " At last one morning the pilot said In one more night we shall get out of the sand " )
( train_bengalifemale_01129 " The men were glad to hear this for they were tired " )
( train_bengalifemale_01130 " After supper that night the merchant said You may as well throw away nearly all the water and the firewood " )
( train_bengalifemale_01131 " By tomorrow we shall be in the city " )
( train_bengalifemale_01132 " Yoke the oxen and start on " )
( train_bengalifemale_01133 " Then the pilot took his place at the head of the line " )
( train_bengalifemale_01134 " But instead of sitting up and guiding the drivers he lay down in the wagon on the cushions " )
( train_bengalifemale_01135 " Soon he was fast asleep because he had not slept for many nights and the light had been so strong in the daytime that he had not slept well then " )
( train_bengalifemale_01136 " All night long the oxen went on " )
( train_bengalifemale_01137 " Near daybreak the pilot awoke and looked at the last stars fading in the light " )
( train_bengalifemale_01138 " Halt he called to the drivers " )
( train_bengalifemale_01139 " We are in the same place where we were yesterday " )
( train_bengalifemale_01140 " The oxen must have turned about while I slept " )
( train_bengalifemale_01141 " They unyoked the oxen but there was no water for them to drink " )
( train_bengalifemale_01142 " They had thrown away the water that was left the night before " )
( train_bengalifemale_01143 " So the men spread the awning over the carts and the oxen lay down tired and thirsty " )
( train_bengalifemale_01144 " The men too lay down saying The wood and water are gone we are lost " )
( train_bengalifemale_01145 " But the merchant said to himself This is no time for me to sleep " )
( train_bengalifemale_01146 " I must find water The oxen cannot go on if they do not have water to drink " )
( train_bengalifemale_01147 " The men must have water They cannot cook the rice unless they have water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01148 " If I give up we shall all be lost " )
( train_bengalifemale_01149 " On and on he walked keeping close watch of the ground " )
( train_bengalifemale_01150 " At last he saw a tuft of grass " )
( train_bengalifemale_01151 " There must be water somewhere below or that grass would not be there he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01152 " He ran back shouting to the men Bring the spade and the hammer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01153 " They jumped up and ran with him to the spot where the grass grew " )
( train_bengalifemale_01154 " They began to dig and by and by they struck a rock and could dig no further " )
( train_bengalifemale_01155 " Then the merchant jumped down into the hole they had dug and put his ear to the rock " )
( train_bengalifemale_01156 " I hear water running under this rock he called to them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01157 " We must not give up Then the merchant came up out of the hole and said to a serving lad " )
( train_bengalifemale_01158 " My boy if you give up we are lost You go down and try " )
( train_bengalifemale_01159 " The boy stood up straight and raised the hammer high above his head and hit the rock as hard as ever he could " )
( train_bengalifemale_01160 " He would not give in They must be saved " )
( train_bengalifemale_01161 " Down came the hammer This time the rock broke " )
( train_bengalifemale_01162 " And the boy had hardly time to get out of the well before it was full of cool water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01163 " The men drank as if they never could get enough and then they watered the oxen and bathed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01164 " Then they split up their extra yokes and axles and built a fire and cooked their rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01165 " Feeling better they rested through the day " )
( train_bengalifemale_01166 " They set up a flag on the well for travelers to see " )
( train_bengalifemale_01167 " At sundown they started on again and the next morning reached the city " )
( train_bengalifemale_01168 " They sold the goods and then returned home " )
( train_bengalifemale_01169 " ONCE upon a time many quails lived together in a forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01170 " The wisest of them all was their leader " )
( train_bengalifemale_01171 " A man lived near the forest and earned his living by catching quails and selling them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01172 " Day after day he listened to the note of the leader calling the quails " )
( train_bengalifemale_01173 " By and by this man the fowler was able to call the quails together " )
( train_bengalifemale_01174 " Hearing the note the quails thought it was their leader who called " )
( train_bengalifemale_01175 " When they were crowded together the fowler threw his net over them and off he went into the town " )
( train_bengalifemale_01176 " He soon sold all the quails that he had caught " )
( train_bengalifemale_01177 " The wise leader saw the plan of the fowler for catching the quails " )
( train_bengalifemale_01178 " He called the birds to him and said This fowler is carrying away so many of us we must put a stop to it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01179 " I have thought of a plan it is this " )
( train_bengalifemale_01180 " The next time the fowler throws a net over you " )
( train_bengalifemale_01181 " Each of you must put your head through one of the little holes in the net " )
( train_bengalifemale_01182 " Then all of you together must fly away to the nearest thorn bush " )
( train_bengalifemale_01183 " You can leave the net on the thorn bush and be free yourselves " )
( train_bengalifemale_01184 " The quails said that was a very good plan " )
( train_bengalifemale_01185 " They would try it the next time the fowler threw the net over them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01186 " The very next day the fowler came and called them together " )
( train_bengalifemale_01187 " Then he threw the net over them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01188 " The quails lifted the net and flew away with it to the nearest thorn bush where they left it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01189 " They flew back to their leader to tell him how well his plan had worked " )
( train_bengalifemale_01190 " The fowler was busy until evening getting his net off the thorns and he went home empty handed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01191 " The next day the same thing happened and the next " )
( train_bengalifemale_01192 " His wife was angry because he did not bring home any money but the fowler said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01193 " The fact is those quails are working together now " )
( train_bengalifemale_01194 " The moment my net is over them off they fly with it leaving it on a thorn bush " )
( train_bengalifemale_01195 " As soon as the quails begin to quarrel I shall be able to catch them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01196 " Not long after this one of the quails in alighting on their feeding ground trod by accident on another's head " )
( train_bengalifemale_01197 " Who trod on my head angrily cried the second " )
( train_bengalifemale_01198 " I did but I didn't mean to do not be angry said the first quail " )
( train_bengalifemale_01199 " But the second quail was angry and said mean things " )
( train_bengalifemale_01200 " Soon all the quails had taken sides in this quarrel " )
( train_bengalifemale_01201 " When the fowler came that day he flung his net over them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01202 " This time instead of flying off with it the quails quarreled " )
( train_bengalifemale_01203 " While they were quarreling the fowler caught them all in his net " )
( train_bengalifemale_01204 " He took them to town and sold them for a good price " )
( train_bengalifemale_01205 " At one time a dishonest king had a man called the valuer in his court " )
( train_bengalifemale_01206 " The valuer set the price which ought to be paid for horses and elephants and the other animals " )
( train_bengalifemale_01207 " He also set the price on jewelry and gold and things of that kind " )
( train_bengalifemale_01208 " This man was honest and just and set the proper price to be paid to the owners of the goods " )
( train_bengalifemale_01209 " The king was not pleased with this valuer because he was honest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01210 " If I had another sort of a man as valuer I might gain more riches he thought " )
( train_bengalifemale_01211 " One day the king saw a stupid miserly peasant come into the palace yard " )
( train_bengalifemale_01212 " The king sent for the fellow and asked him if he would like to be the valuer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01213 " The peasant said he would like the position " )
( train_bengalifemale_01214 " So the king had him made valuer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01215 " He sent the honest valuer away from the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_01216 " Then the peasant began to set the prices on horses and elephants upon gold and jewels " )
( train_bengalifemale_01217 " He did not know their value so he would say anything he chose " )
( train_bengalifemale_01218 " As the king had made him valuer the people had to sell their goods for the price he set " )
( train_bengalifemale_01219 " By and by a horse dealer brought five hundred horses to the court of this king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01220 " The valuer came and said they were worth a mere measure of rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01221 " So the king ordered the horse dealer to be given the measure of rice and the horses to be put in the palace stables " )
( train_bengalifemale_01222 " The horse dealer went then to see the honest man who had been the valuer and told him what had happened " )
( train_bengalifemale_01223 " What shall I do asked the horse dealer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01224 " I think you can give a present to the valuer which will make him do what you say said the man " )
( train_bengalifemale_01225 " Go to him and give him a fine present then say to him 'You said the horses are worth a measure of rice but now tell what a measure of rice is worth " )
( train_bengalifemale_01226 " Can you value that standing in your place by the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01227 " If he says he can go with him to the king and I will be there too " )
( train_bengalifemale_01228 " The horse dealer thought this was a good idea " )
( train_bengalifemale_01229 " So he took a fine present to the valuer and said what the other man had told him to say " )
( train_bengalifemale_01230 " The valuer took the present " )
( train_bengalifemale_01231 " He said Yes I can go before the king with you and tell what a measure of rice is worth I can value that now " )
( train_bengalifemale_01232 " Well let us go at once said the horse dealer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01233 " So they went before the king and his ministers in the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_01234 " The horse dealer bowed down before the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01235 " He said O King I have learned that a measure of rice is the value of my five hundred horses " )
( train_bengalifemale_01236 " But will the king be pleased to ask the valuer what is the value of the measure of rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01237 " A measure of rice O King said he " )
( train_bengalifemale_01238 " Very good then If five hundred horses are worth a measure of rice what is the measure of rice worth " )
( train_bengalifemale_01239 " The measure of rice is worth your whole city replied the foolish fellow " )
( train_bengalifemale_01240 " The ministers clapped their hands laughing " )
( train_bengalifemale_01241 " What a foolish valuer How can such a man hold that office " )
( train_bengalifemale_01242 " We used to think this great city was beyond price but this man says it is worth only a measure of rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01243 " Then the king was ashamed and drove out the foolish fellow " )
( train_bengalifemale_01244 " I tried to please the king by setting a low price on the horses and now see what has happened to me said the valuer as he ran away from the laughing crowd " )
( train_bengalifemale_01245 " Once upon a time a Rabbit was asleep under a palm tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_01246 " All at once he woke up and thought What if the world should break up What then would become of me " )
( train_bengalifemale_01247 " At that moment some monkey dropped a coconut " )
( train_bengalifemale_01248 " It fell down on the ground just back of the Rabbit " )
( train_bengalifemale_01249 " Hearing the noise the Rabbit said to himself The earth is all breaking up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01250 " And he jumped up and ran just as fast as he could without even looking back to see what made the noise " )
( train_bengalifemale_01251 " Another Rabbit saw him running and called after him What are you running so fast for " )
( train_bengalifemale_01252 " do not ask me he cried " )
( train_bengalifemale_01253 " But the other Rabbit ran after him begging to know what the matter was " )
( train_bengalifemale_01254 " Then the first Rabbit said do you not know " )
( train_bengalifemale_01255 " The earth is all breaking up And on he ran and the second Rabbit ran with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01256 " The next Rabbit they met ran with them when he heard that the earth was all breaking up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01257 " One Rabbit after another joined them until there were hundreds of Rabbits running as fast as they could go " )
( train_bengalifemale_01258 " They passed a Deer calling out to him that the earth was all breaking up The Deer then ran with them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01259 " The Deer called to a Fox to come along because the earth was all breaking up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01260 " At last the Lion saw the animals running and heard their cry that the earth was all breaking up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01261 " He thought there must be some mistake so he ran to the foot of a hill in front of them and roared three times " )
( train_bengalifemale_01262 " This stopped them for they knew the voice of the King of Beasts and they feared him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01263 " Why are you running so fast asked the Lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_01264 " King Lion they answered him the earth is all breaking up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01265 " Who saw it breaking up asked the Lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_01266 " I didn't said the Elephant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01267 " Ask the Fox he told me about it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01268 " I didn't said the Fox " )
( train_bengalifemale_01269 " The Rabbits told me about it said the Deer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01270 " One after another of the Rabbits said I did not see it but another Rabbit told me about it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01271 " At last the Lion came to the Rabbit who had first said the earth was all breaking up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01272 " Is it true that the earth is all breaking up the Lion asked " )
( train_bengalifemale_01273 " Yes O Lion it is said the Rabbit " )
( train_bengalifemale_01274 " I was asleep under a palm tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_01275 " I woke up and thought 'What would become of me if the earth should all break up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01276 " Then said the Lion you and I will go back to the place where the earth began to break up and see what is the matter " )
( train_bengalifemale_01277 " So the Lion put the little Rabbit on his back and away they went like the wind " )
( train_bengalifemale_01278 " The other animals waited for them at the foot of the hill " )
( train_bengalifemale_01279 " The Rabbit told the Lion when they were near the place where he slept and the Lion saw just where the Rabbit had been sleeping " )
( train_bengalifemale_01280 " He saw too the coconut that had fallen to the ground nearby " )
( train_bengalifemale_01281 " Then the Lion said to the Rabbit It must have been the sound of the coconut falling to the ground that you heard You foolish Rabbit " )
( train_bengalifemale_01282 " And the Lion ran back to the other animals and told them all about it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01283 " If it had not been for the wise King of Beasts they might be running still " )
( train_bengalifemale_01284 " Once upon a time in a certain country a thrifty merchant visited a great city and bought a great supply of goods " )
( train_bengalifemale_01285 " He loaded wagons with the goods which he was going to sell as he traveled through the country " )
( train_bengalifemale_01286 " A stupid young merchant was buying goods in the same city " )
( train_bengalifemale_01287 " He too was going to sell what he bought as he travelled through the country " )
( train_bengalifemale_01288 " They were both ready to start at the same time " )
( train_bengalifemale_01289 " The thrifty merchant thought We cannot travel together for the men will find it hard to get wood and water and there will not be enough grass for so many oxen " )
( train_bengalifemale_01290 " Either he or I ought to go first " )
( train_bengalifemale_01291 " So he went to the young man and told him this saying Will you go before or come on after me " )
( train_bengalifemale_01292 " The other one thought It will be better for me to go first " )
( train_bengalifemale_01293 " I shall then travel on a road that is not cut up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01294 " The oxen will eat grass that has not been touched " )
( train_bengalifemale_01295 " The water will be clean Also I shall sell my goods at what price I like " )
( train_bengalifemale_01296 " So he said Friend I will go on first " )
( train_bengalifemale_01297 " This answer pleased the thrifty merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01298 " He said to himself Those who go before will make the rough places smooth " )
( train_bengalifemale_01299 " The old rank grass will have been eaten by the oxen that have gone before while my oxen will eat the freshly grown tender shoots " )
( train_bengalifemale_01300 " Those who go before will dig wells from which we shall drink " )
( train_bengalifemale_01301 " Then too I will not have to bother about setting prices but I can sell my goods at the prices set by the other man " )
( train_bengalifemale_01302 " So he said aloud Very well friend you may go on first " )
( train_bengalifemale_01303 " At once the foolish merchant started on his journey " )
( train_bengalifemale_01304 " Soon he had left the city and was in the country " )
( train_bengalifemale_01305 " By and by he came to a desert which he had to cross " )
( train_bengalifemale_01306 " So he filled great water jars with water loaded them into a large wagon and started across the desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_01307 " Now on the sands of this desert there lived a wicked demon " )
( train_bengalifemale_01308 " So the demon went further along the road and changed himself into the likeness of a noble gentleman " )
( train_bengalifemale_01309 " He called up a beautiful carriage drawn by milk white oxen " )
( train_bengalifemale_01310 " Then he called ten other demons dressed them like men and armed them with bows and arrows swords and shields " )
( train_bengalifemale_01311 " Seated in his carriage followed by the ten demons he rode back to meet the merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01312 " He put mud on the carriage wheels hung water lilies and wet grasses upon the oxen and the carriage " )
( train_bengalifemale_01313 " Then he made the clothes the demons wore and their hair all wet " )
( train_bengalifemale_01314 " Drops of water trickled down over their faces just as if they had all come through a stream " )
( train_bengalifemale_01315 " As the demons neared the foolish merchant they turned their carriage to one side of the way saying pleasantly Where are you going " )
( train_bengalifemale_01316 " The merchant replied We have come from the great city back there and are going across the desert to the villages beyond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01317 " You come dripping with mud and carrying water lilies and grasses " )
( train_bengalifemale_01318 " Does it rain on the road you have come by " )
( train_bengalifemale_01319 " Did you come through a stream " )
( train_bengalifemale_01320 " The demon answered The dark streak across the sky is a forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01321 " In it there are ponds full of water lilies The rains come often " )
( train_bengalifemale_01322 " What have you in all those carts " )
( train_bengalifemale_01323 " Goods to be sold replied the merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01324 " But in that last big heavy wagon what do you carry the demon asked " )
( train_bengalifemale_01325 " Jars full of water for the journey answered the merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01326 " The demon said You have done well to bring water as far as this but there is no need of it beyond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01327 " Empty out all that water and go on easily " )
( train_bengalifemale_01328 " Then he added But we have delayed too long Drive on " )
( train_bengalifemale_01329 " And he drove on until he was out of sight of the merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01330 " Then he returned to his home with his followers to wait for the night to come " )
( train_bengalifemale_01331 " The foolish merchant did as the demon told him and emptied every jar saving not even a cupful " )
( train_bengalifemale_01332 " There was no forest the dark line being only clouds " )
( train_bengalifemale_01333 " No water was to be found " )
( train_bengalifemale_01334 " The men had no water to drink and no food to eat for they had no water in which to cook their rice " )
( train_bengalifemale_01335 " They went thirsty and supperless to bed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01336 " The oxen too were hungry and thirsty and dropped down to sleep here and there " )
( train_bengalifemale_01337 " Late at night the demons fell upon them and easily carried off every man " )
( train_bengalifemale_01338 " They drove the oxen on ahead of them but the loaded carts they did not care to take away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01339 " A month and a half after this the wise merchant followed over the same road " )
( train_bengalifemale_01340 " He too was met on the desert by the demon just as the other had been " )
( train_bengalifemale_01341 " But the wise man knew the man was a demon because he cast no shadow " )
( train_bengalifemale_01342 " The demon told him of the ponds in the forest ahead and advised him to throw away the water jars " )
( train_bengalifemale_01343 " The wise merchant replied We do not throw away the water we have until we get to a place where we see there is more " )
( train_bengalifemale_01344 " Then the demon drove on But the men who were with the merchant protested against it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01345 " Stopping all the carts the wise merchant asked the men Have you ever heard any one say that there was a lake or pond in this desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_01346 " You have lived near here always " )
( train_bengalifemale_01347 " We never heard of a pond or lake they said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01348 " Does any man feel a wind laden with dampness blowing against him he asked " )
( train_bengalifemale_01349 " No sir they answered " )
( train_bengalifemale_01350 " Can you see a rain cloud any of you " )
( train_bengalifemale_01351 " No sir not one they said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01352 " Those fellows were not men they were demons said the wise merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01353 " They must have come out to make us throw away the water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01354 " Then when we were faint and weak they might have put an end to us " )
( train_bengalifemale_01355 " Go on at once and do not throw away a single half pint of water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01356 " So they drove on and before nightfall they came upon the loaded wagons belonging to the foolish merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01357 " Then the thrifty merchant had his wagons drawn up in a circle " )
( train_bengalifemale_01358 " In the middle of the circle he had the oxen lie down and also some of the men " )
( train_bengalifemale_01359 " He himself with the head men stood on guard swords in hand and waited for the demons " )
( train_bengalifemale_01360 " But the demons did not bother them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01361 " Early the next day the thrifty merchant took the best of the wagons left by the foolish merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01362 " He went on safely to the city across the desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_01363 " There he sold all the goods at a profit and returned with his company to his own city " )
( train_bengalifemale_01364 " Once upon a time a king had an Elephant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01365 " The Elephant was so gentle and good and looked so kind " )
( train_bengalifemale_01366 " He never hurts anybody the keeper of the Elephants often said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01367 " Now one night some robbers came into the courtyard and sat on the ground just outside the stall where the elephant slept " )
( train_bengalifemale_01368 " The talk of the robbers awoke Girly face " )
( train_bengalifemale_01369 " This is the way to break into a house they said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01370 " Once inside the house kill anyone who wakens " )
( train_bengalifemale_01371 " A robber must not be afraid to kill " )
( train_bengalifemale_01372 " A robber must be cruel and have no pity " )
( train_bengalifemale_01373 " He must never be good even for a moment " )
( train_bengalifemale_01374 " The elephant said to himself Those men are teaching me how I should act " )
( train_bengalifemale_01375 " I will be cruel I will show no pity " )
( train_bengalifemale_01376 " I will not be good Not even for a moment " )
( train_bengalifemale_01377 " The next morning the keeper came to feed him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01378 " He picked him up in his trunk and threw the poor keeper to the ground killing him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01379 " Another keeper ran to see what the trouble was and the elephant killed him too " )
( train_bengalifemale_01380 " For days and days the elephant was so ugly that no one dared go near " )
( train_bengalifemale_01381 " The food was left for him but no man would go near him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01382 " By and by the king heard of this and sent one of his wise men to find out what happened to the elephant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01383 " The wise man had known the elephant a long time " )
( train_bengalifemale_01384 " He thought at last The elephant must have heard some bad men talking " )
( train_bengalifemale_01385 " Have there been any bad men talking about here asked the wise man " )
( train_bengalifemale_01386 " Yes one of the keepers said a band of robbers were caught here a few weeks ago " )
( train_bengalifemale_01387 " They had met in the yard to talk over their plans " )
( train_bengalifemale_01388 " They were talking together near the stall where the elephant sleeps " )
( train_bengalifemale_01389 " So the wise man went back to the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01390 " He said I think the elephant has been listening to bad talk " )
( train_bengalifemale_01391 " Send some good men to talk where the elephant can hear them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01392 " I think he will be a good Elephant once more " )
( train_bengalifemale_01393 " They said to one another It is wrong to hurt anyone " )
( train_bengalifemale_01394 " It is wrong to kill Everyone should be gentle and good " )
( train_bengalifemale_01395 " Now those men are teaching me thought the elephant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01396 " I must be gentle and good I must hurt no one I must not kill any one " )
( train_bengalifemale_01397 " And from that time on the elephant was tame and as good as ever an Elephant could be " )
( train_bengalifemale_01398 " There was once a Deer the color of gold " )
( train_bengalifemale_01399 " His eyes were like round jewels his horns were white as silver " )
( train_bengalifemale_01400 " His mouth was red like a flower his hoofs were bright and hard " )
( train_bengalifemale_01401 " He had a large body and a fine tail " )
( train_bengalifemale_01402 " He lived in a forest and was king of a herd of five hundred Banyan Deer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01403 " Nearby lived another herd of Deer called the monkey Deer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01404 " They too had a king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01405 " The king of that country was fond of hunting the Deer and eating deer meat " )
( train_bengalifemale_01406 " He did not like to go alone so he called the people of his town to go with him day after day " )
( train_bengalifemale_01407 " The towns people did not like this for while they were gone no one did their work " )
( train_bengalifemale_01408 " So they decided to make a park and drive the Deer into it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01409 " Then the king could go into the park and hunt and they could go on with their daily work " )
( train_bengalifemale_01410 " They made a park planted grass in it and provided water for the Deer built a fence all around it and drove the Deer into it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01411 " Then they shut the gate and went to the king to tell him that in the park nearby he could find all the Deer he wanted " )
( train_bengalifemale_01412 " The king went at once to look at the Deer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01413 " First he saw there the two Deer kings and granted them their lives " )
( train_bengalifemale_01414 " Then he looked at their great herds " )
( train_bengalifemale_01415 " Some days the king would go to hunt the Deer sometimes his cook would go " )
( train_bengalifemale_01416 " As soon as any of the Deer saw them they would shake with fear and run " )
( train_bengalifemale_01417 " But when they had been hit once or twice they would drop down dead " )
( train_bengalifemale_01418 " The King of the Banyan Deer sent for the King of the monkey Deer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01419 " He said Friend many of the Deer are being killed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01420 " Many are wounded besides those who are killed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01421 " After this suppose one from my herd goes up to be killed one day and the next day let one from your herd go up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01422 " Fewer Deer will be lost this way The monkey Deer agreed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01423 " Each day the Deer whose turn it was would go and lie down placing its head on the block " )
( train_bengalifemale_01424 " The cook would come and carry off the one he found lying there " )
( train_bengalifemale_01425 " One day the lot fell to a mother Deer who had a young baby She went to her king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01426 " She said O King of the monkey Deer let the turn pass me by until my baby is old enough to get along without me " )
( train_bengalifemale_01427 " Then I will go and put my head on the block " )
( train_bengalifemale_01428 " But the king did not help her " )
( train_bengalifemale_01429 " He told her that if the lot had fallen to her she must die " )
( train_bengalifemale_01430 " Then she went to the King of the Banyan Deer and asked him to save her " )
( train_bengalifemale_01431 " Go back to your herd " )
( train_bengalifemale_01432 " I will go in your place said he " )
( train_bengalifemale_01433 " The next day the cook found the King of the Banyan Deer lying with his head on the block " )
( train_bengalifemale_01434 " The cook went to the king who came himself to find out about this " )
( train_bengalifemale_01435 " King of the Banyan Deer did I not grant you your life " )
( train_bengalifemale_01436 " Why are you lying here " )
( train_bengalifemale_01437 " The King of the Banyan Deer said to the king Great king a mother came with her young baby and told me that the lot had fallen to her " )
( train_bengalifemale_01438 " I could not ask anyone else to take her place so I came myself " )
( train_bengalifemale_01439 " King of the Banyan Deer I never saw such kindness and mercy Rise up " )
( train_bengalifemale_01440 " I grant your life and hers " )
( train_bengalifemale_01441 " Nor will I hunt any more the Deer in either park or forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01442 " Once upon a time a king had three sons " )
( train_bengalifemale_01443 " The first was called Prince of the Stars " )
( train_bengalifemale_01444 " The next was called the Moon Prince and the third was called the Sun Prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_01445 " The king was so very happy when the third son was born that he promised to give the queen any boon she might ask " )
( train_bengalifemale_01446 " On the twenty first birthday of the Sun Prince she said to the king Great King when our youngest child was born you said you would give me a boon " )
( train_bengalifemale_01447 " But the king refused saying that the kingdom must go to the oldest son " )
( train_bengalifemale_01448 " It belongs by right to him Next it would belong by right to the second son " )
( train_bengalifemale_01449 " Not until they were both dead could the kingdom go to the third son " )
( train_bengalifemale_01450 " He feared that she would do harm to the older princes to get them out of the way of the Sun Prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_01451 " So he called his elder sons and told them that they must go and live in the forest until his death " )
( train_bengalifemale_01452 " Then come back and reign in the city that is yours by right he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_01453 " And with tears he kissed them on the foreheads and sent them away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01454 " As they were going down out of the palace the Sun Prince asked them where they were going " )
( train_bengalifemale_01455 " And when he heard where they were going and why he said I will go with you my brothers " )
( train_bengalifemale_01456 " So off they started They went on and on and by and by they reached the forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01457 " There they sat down to rest in the shade of a pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01458 " Then the eldest brother said to Sun Prince Go down to the pond and bathe and drink " )
( train_bengalifemale_01459 " Then bring us a drink while we rest here " )
( train_bengalifemale_01460 " Now the King of the Fairies had given this pond to a water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01461 " The Fairy King had said to the water sprite You are to have in your power all who go down into the water except those who give the right answer to one question " )
( train_bengalifemale_01462 " The question is What are the Good Fairies like " )
( train_bengalifemale_01463 " When the Sun Prince went into the pond the water sprite saw him and asked him the question " )
( train_bengalifemale_01464 " They are like the Sun and the Moon said the Sun Prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_01465 " You do not know what the Good Fairies are like cried the water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01466 " He carried the poor boy down into her cave " )
( train_bengalifemale_01467 " By and by the eldest brother said Moon Prince go down and see why our brother stays so long in the pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01468 " As soon as the Moon Prince reached the water's edge the water sprite called to him and asked him the question " )
( train_bengalifemale_01469 " Like the sky above us replied the Moon Prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_01470 " You do not know either said the water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01471 " He then dragged the Moon Prince down into the cave where the Sun Prince sat " )
( train_bengalifemale_01472 " Something must have happened to those two brothers of mine thought the eldest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01473 " So he went to the pond and saw the marks of the footsteps where his brothers had gone down into the water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01474 " Then he knew that a water sprite must live in that pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01475 " He girded on his sword and stood with his bow in his hand " )
( train_bengalifemale_01476 " The water sprite soon came along in the form of a woodsman " )
( train_bengalifemale_01477 " You seem tired Friend he said to the prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_01478 " Why do not you bathe in the lake and then lie on the bank and rest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01479 " But the prince knew that it was a water sprite and he said You have carried off my brothers " )
( train_bengalifemale_01480 " Yes said the water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01481 " Because they did not answer my question said the water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01482 " I have power over all who go down into the water except those who do give the right answer " )
( train_bengalifemale_01483 " I will answer your question said the eldest brother And he did " )
( train_bengalifemale_01484 " The Good Fairies are like the pure in heart who fear to sin The good kindly in word and deed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01485 " O Wise Prince I will bring back to you one of your brothers Which shall I bring said the water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01486 " Bring me the younger one said the prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_01487 " It was on his account that our father sent us away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01488 " I could never go away with Moon Prince and leave poor Sun Prince here " )
( train_bengalifemale_01489 " O Wise Prince you know what the good should do and you are kind " )
( train_bengalifemale_01490 " I will bring back both your brothers said the water sprite " )
( train_bengalifemale_01491 " After that the three princes lived together in the forest until the king died " )
( train_bengalifemale_01492 " Then they went back to the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_01493 " The eldest brother was made king and he had his brothers rule with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01494 " He also built a home for the water sprite in the palace grounds " )
( train_bengalifemale_01495 " He held up one foot and the carpenters saw that it was swollen and sore " )
( train_bengalifemale_01496 " Then the Elephant lay down and the men saw that there was a great splinter in the sore foot " )
( train_bengalifemale_01497 " They pulled it out and washed the sore carefully so that in a short time it would be well again " )
( train_bengalifemale_01498 " Thankful for the cure the Elephant thought These carpenters have done so much for me I must be useful to them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01499 " So after that the Elephant used to pull up trees for the carpenters " )
( train_bengalifemale_01500 " Sometimes when the trees were chopped down he would roll the logs down to the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_01501 " Other times he brought their tools for them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01502 " And the carpenters used to feed him well morning noon and night " )
( train_bengalifemale_01503 " Now this Elephant had a son who was white all over a beautiful strong young one " )
( train_bengalifemale_01504 " The old Elephant said to himself I will take my son to the place in the forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_01505 " So the old Elephant told his son how the carpenters had taken good care of him when he was badly hurt and took him to them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01506 " The white Elephant did as his father told him to do and helped the carpenters and they fed him well " )
( train_bengalifemale_01507 " When the work was done at night the young Elephant went to play in the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_01508 " The carpenters' children played with him in the water and on the bank " )
( train_bengalifemale_01509 " He liked to pick them up in his trunk and set them on the high branches of the trees and then let them climb down on his back " )
( train_bengalifemale_01510 " One day the king came down the river and saw this beautiful white Elephant working for the carpenters " )
( train_bengalifemale_01511 " The king at once wanted the Elephant for himself and paid the carpenters a great price for him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01512 " Then with a last look at his playmates the children the beautiful white Elephant went on with the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01513 " The king was proud of his new Elephant and took the best care of him as long as he lived " )
( train_bengalifemale_01514 " Once upon a time there was an Ox named Big Red " )
( train_bengalifemale_01515 " He had a younger brother named Little Red " )
( train_bengalifemale_01516 " These two brothers did all the carting on a large farm " )
( train_bengalifemale_01517 " Now the farmer had an only daughter and she was soon to be married " )
( train_bengalifemale_01518 " Her mother gave orders that the Pig should be fattened for the wedding feast " )
( train_bengalifemale_01519 " Little Red noticed that the Pig was fed on choice food " )
( train_bengalifemale_01520 " He said to his brother How is it Big Red that you and I are given only straw and grass to eat We do all the hard work on the farm " )
( train_bengalifemale_01521 " That lazy Pig does nothing but eat the choice food the farmer gives him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01522 " Said his brother My dear Little Red do not envy him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01523 " That little Pig is eating the food of death " )
( train_bengalifemale_01524 " He is being fattened for the wedding feast " )
( train_bengalifemale_01525 " Eat your straw and grass and be content and live long " )
( train_bengalifemale_01526 " Not long afterwards the fattened Pig was killed and cooked for the wedding feast " )
( train_bengalifemale_01527 " Then Big Red said Did you see Little Red what became of the Pig after all his fine feeding " )
( train_bengalifemale_01528 " Yes said the little brother we can go on eating plain food for years " )
( train_bengalifemale_01529 " The poor little Pig ate the food of death and now he is dead " )
( train_bengalifemale_01530 " His feed was good while it lasted but it did not last long " )
( train_bengalifemale_01531 " Once upon a time a rich man gave a baby Elephant to a woman " )
( train_bengalifemale_01532 " The children in the village called her Granny and they called the Elephant Granny's Blackie " )
( train_bengalifemale_01533 " The Elephant carried the children on his back all over the village " )
( train_bengalifemale_01534 " They shared their goodies with him and he played with them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01535 " Please Blackie give us a swing they said to him almost every day " )
( train_bengalifemale_01536 " Come on Who is first Blackie answered and picked them up with his trunk swung them high in the air " )
( train_bengalifemale_01537 " Then he put them down again carefully " )
( train_bengalifemale_01538 " But Blackie never did any work " )
( train_bengalifemale_01539 " One day Blackie wanted Granny to go off to the woods with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01540 " I can't go Blackie dear I have too much work to do " )
( train_bengalifemale_01541 " Then Blackie looked at her and saw that she was growing old and feeble " )
( train_bengalifemale_01542 " I will see if I can find some work to do " )
( train_bengalifemale_01543 " If I could bring some money home to her she would not have to work so hard " )
( train_bengalifemale_01544 " So next morning bright and early he started down to the river bank " )
( train_bengalifemale_01545 " There he found a man who was in great trouble " )
( train_bengalifemale_01546 " There was a long line of wagons so heavily loaded that the oxen could not draw them through the shallow water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01547 " When the man saw Blackie standing on the bank he asked Who owns this Elephant " )
( train_bengalifemale_01548 " I want to hire him to help my Oxen pull these wagons across the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_01549 " Very well said the man I will pay two pieces of silver for each wagon this Elephant draws across the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_01550 " Blackie was glad to hear this promise " )
( train_bengalifemale_01551 " He went into the river and drew one wagon after another across to the other side " )
( train_bengalifemale_01552 " Then he went up to the man for the money " )
( train_bengalifemale_01553 " The man counted out one piece of silver for each wagon " )
( train_bengalifemale_01554 " When Blackie saw that the man had counted out but one piece of silver for each wagon instead of two he would not touch the money at all " )
( train_bengalifemale_01555 " He stood in the road and would not let the wagons pass him " )
( train_bengalifemale_01556 " The man tried to get Blackie out of the way but not one step would he move " )
( train_bengalifemale_01557 " Then Blackie started for home proud to think that he had a present for Granny " )
( train_bengalifemale_01558 " The children had missed Blackie and had asked Granny where he was but she said she did not know where he had gone " )
( train_bengalifemale_01559 " They all looked for him but it was nearly night before they heard him coming " )
( train_bengalifemale_01560 " Where have you been Blackie And what is that around your neck the children cried running to meet their playmate " )
( train_bengalifemale_01561 " But Blackie would not stop to talk with his playmates " )
( train_bengalifemale_01562 " He ran straight home to Granny " )
( train_bengalifemale_01563 " Oh Blackie she said Where have you been " )
( train_bengalifemale_01564 " What is in that bag And she took the bag off his neck " )
( train_bengalifemale_01565 " Blackie told her that he had earned some money for her " )
( train_bengalifemale_01566 " Oh Blackie Blackie said Granny how hard you must have worked to earn these pieces of silver What a good Blackie you are " )
( train_bengalifemale_01567 " And after that Blackie did all the hard work and Granny rested and they were both very happy " )
( train_bengalifemale_01568 " Long Ago there was a summer when very little rain fell " )
( train_bengalifemale_01569 " All the Animals suffered for want of water but the Fishes suffered most of all " )
( train_bengalifemale_01570 " In one pond full of Fishes the water was very low indeed " )
( train_bengalifemale_01571 " A Crane sat on the bank watching the Fishes " )
( train_bengalifemale_01572 " What are you doing asked a little Fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01573 " I am thinking about you Fishes there in the pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01574 " It is so nearly dry answered the Crane " )
( train_bengalifemale_01575 " Yes the Crane went on I was wishing I might do something for you " )
( train_bengalifemale_01576 " I know of a pond in the deep woods where there is plenty of water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01577 " I declare said the little Fish you are the first Crane that ever offered to help a Fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01578 " That may be said the Crane but the water is so low in your pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01579 " I could easily carry you one by one on my back to that other pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01580 " There is plenty of water food and cool shade there " )
( train_bengalifemale_01581 " I do not believe there is any such pond said the little Fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01582 " What you wish to do is to eat us one by one " )
( train_bengalifemale_01583 " If you do not believe me said the Crane send with me one of the Fishes whom you can believe " )
( train_bengalifemale_01584 " I will show him the pond and bring him back to tell you all about it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01585 " A big Fish heard the Crane " )
( train_bengalifemale_01586 " He said I will go with you to see the pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01587 " I may as well be eaten by the Crane as to die here " )
( train_bengalifemale_01588 " So the Crane put the big Fish on his back and started for the deep woods " )
( train_bengalifemale_01589 " Soon the Crane showed the big Fish the pool of water " )
( train_bengalifemale_01590 " See how cool and shady it is here he said and how much larger the pond is and how full it is " )
( train_bengalifemale_01591 " Yes said the big Fish take me back to the little pond and I will tell the other Fishes all about it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01592 " So back they went The Fishes all wanted to go when they heard the big Fish talk about the fine pond which he had seen " )
( train_bengalifemale_01593 " Then the Crane picked up another Fish and carried it away " )
( train_bengalifemale_01594 " Then the Crane put the Fish down and ate it " )
( train_bengalifemale_01595 " The Crane went back for another Fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01596 " He carried it to the same place in the woods and ate it too " )
( train_bengalifemale_01597 " This he did until he had eaten all the Fishes in the pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_01598 " The next day the Crane went to the pond to see if he had left a Fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_01599 " There was not one left but there was a Crab on the sand " )
( train_bengalifemale_01600 " Little Crab would you let me take you to the fine pond in the deep woods where I took the Fishes asked the crane " )
( train_bengalifemale_01601 " Oh easily answered the Crane " )
( train_bengalifemale_01602 " I will take you on my back as I did the Fishes " )
( train_bengalifemale_01603 " No I thank you said the Crab I can't go that way " )
( train_bengalifemale_01604 " I am afraid you might drop me " )
( train_bengalifemale_01605 " If I could take hold of your neck with my claws I would go " )
( train_bengalifemale_01606 " You know we Crabs have a tight grip " )
( train_bengalifemale_01607 " The Crane knew about the tight grip of the Crabs and he did not like to have the Crab hold on with his claws " )
( train_bengalifemale_01608 " But he was hungry so he said Very well hold tight " )
( train_bengalifemale_01609 " And off went the Crane with the Crab " )
( train_bengalifemale_01610 " When they reached the place where the Crane had eaten the Fishes the Crane said I think you can walk the rest of the way " )
( train_bengalifemale_01611 " Let go of my neck I see no pond said the Crab " )
( train_bengalifemale_01612 " All I can see is a pile of Fish bones " )
( train_bengalifemale_01613 " Is that all that is left of the Fishes " )
( train_bengalifemale_01614 " Yes said the Crane and if you will let go of my neck your shell will be all that will be left of you " )
( train_bengalifemale_01615 " And the Crane put his head down near the ground so that the Crab could get off easily " )
( train_bengalifemale_01616 " But the Crab pinched the Crane's neck so that his head fell off " )
( train_bengalifemale_01617 " Not my shell but your bones are left to dry with the bones of the Fishes said the Crab " )
( train_bengalifemale_01618 " Why is it that Crows torment the Owls as they sleep in the day time " )
( train_bengalifemale_01619 " For the same reason that the Owls try to kill the Crows while they sleep at night " )
( train_bengalifemale_01620 " Listen to a tale of long ago and then you will see why " )
( train_bengalifemale_01621 " Once upon a time the people who lived together when the world was young took a certain man for their king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01622 " The four footed animals also took one of their number for their king " )
( train_bengalifemale_01623 " The fish in the ocean chose a king to rule over them " )
( train_bengalifemale_01624 " Then the birds gathered together on a great flat rock " )
( train_bengalifemale_01625 " One of them said Among men there is a king and among the beasts and the fish have one too; but we birds have none " )
( train_bengalifemale_01626 " We ought to have a king Let us choose one now " )
( train_bengalifemale_01627 " No not all for one old Crow rose up and said For my part I do not want the Owl to be our king " )

( train_bengalifemale_01955 " Nothing comes to be visible in thin air My Lord replied Tenaliraman " )
( train_bengalifemale_01956 " Rayar grew suspicious What do you mean he asked " )
( train_bengalifemale_01957 " Tenaliraman in a low tone audible only to the King said King of Kings These weavers are cheating our eyes and brains with their deceptive speech " )

( train_bengalifemale_01964 " She thought that the only way out would be to fall on the King's feet pleading mercy " )
( train_bengalifemale_01965 " Immediately she did so begging for pardon " )
( train_bengalifemale_01966 " This was how Tenaliraman was once again instrumental in protecting his King " )
( train_bengalifemale_01967 " Since then nudity is being referred as wearing divine clothes " )
( train_bengalifemale_01968 " It was the practice of King Sri Krishna Deva Rayar to visit the jails once a while and review the living standards of the convicted " )
( train_bengalifemale_01969 " During one of his visits two of the jail inmates pleaded for cutting down their punishment period " )
( train_bengalifemale_01970 " They explained that theft was one of the arts in the epics and Vedas and started defining the art of stealing " )
( train_bengalifemale_01971 " However they argued that they would shed the lifestyle and shift for one or the other profession to eke out their living " )
( train_bengalifemale_01972 " Rayar thought for a moment brushing his moustache royally " )
( train_bengalifemale_01973 " It's alright thieves First let me know about your expertise in the art and then decide " )
( train_bengalifemale_01974 " You both have to burgle at Tenaliraman's house and return " )

( train_bengalifemale_01983 " The whole town is on fire with the news about some convicts jumping jail and are said to be at large well within the town " )
( train_bengalifemale_01984 " We should immediately protect all our jewellery and other valuable " )
( train_bengalifemale_01985 " Saying this and by watching carefully around the bushes increased the pitch and shouted " )
( train_bengalifemale_01986 " Bring that bundle with all our gold and jewellery " )
( train_bengalifemale_01987 " A minute later Tenaliraman and his wife with great effort brought a heavy bundle into the backyard and dropped it into the well with big noise " )
( train_bengalifemale_01988 " Sounds of a heavy weight dropping into the water in the well echoed for few seconds " )

( train_bengalifemale_01992 " Both of them slipped into the well together again " )
( train_bengalifemale_01993 " To their dismay it was not a bundle of jewellery but a bundle of small boulders and rocks " )
( train_bengalifemale_01994 " They never understood until then that Tenaliraman hid his precious items somewhere in the house and dropped this into the well " )
( train_bengalifemale_01995 " Tenaliraman called them Dear thieves please draw few more buckets of water from the well " )
( train_bengalifemale_01996 " Only two of the plants are to be watered " )
( train_bengalifemale_01997 " Please hurry up it is close to dawn " )
( train_bengalifemale_01998 " Kindly help me quick and little more like sprinkling chilies on the wounds of burglars " )
( train_bengalifemale_01999 " Both of them were stunned on hearing Tenaliraman's voice " )
( train_bengalifemale_02000 " They told each other Run It is Tenaliraman and sped away crossing the wall with all the tired bodies " )
( train_bengalifemale_02001 " The so called argument of the thieves about the art of stealing and their expertise did not work on Tenaliraman at least " )

( train_bengalifemale_02007 " The Delhi Sultan once got an idea to insult and instantly he sent a wedding invitation to Sri Krishna Deva Rayar " )
( train_bengalifemale_02008 " Going through the contents of the invitation the royal court Vijaya Nagar and the King Rayar went speechless " )

( train_bengalifemale_02011 " Date of marriage and location was also mentioned in the invitation " )
( train_bengalifemale_02012 " The tremor did not stop there " )
( train_bengalifemale_02013 " The warning letter said that in case the King failed to send all the wells in the concerned kingdom such action would be treated as an insult " )
( train_bengalifemale_02014 " That will be liable to face the fury of the Delhi sultan " )
( train_bengalifemale_02015 " Rayar on receiving the invitation along with the letter through a personal messenger from the Sultan of Delhi could not understand what to do about this invitation " )
( train_bengalifemale_02016 " This is because everyone knew that sending wells from one place to another is practically above impossible " )
( train_bengalifemale_02017 " Rayar was in total confusion what to do and what to reply " )
( train_bengalifemale_02018 " Thinking for some time to find a solution to this problem in vain Rayar forwarded the puzzling wedding invitation and warning letter to the Chief Minister Timmarusu " )
( train_bengalifemale_02019 " He also included a message to come out with a viable solution " )
( train_bengalifemale_02020 " Timmarusu found the invitation to be too strange and the problem like a complex puzzle " )

( train_bengalifemale_02022 " Timmarusu approached King Rayar and expressed his inability to draw out any solution " )
( train_bengalifemale_02023 " Rayar was much more tensed on hearing his Chief Minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_02024 " Then Timmarusu convinced Rayar that there was no need to get so much worried as there is a man in the service of the King who can draw a best amicable equation " )

( train_bengalifemale_02038 " Somehow he escaped to reach safely the rabbit said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02039 " He said that the other Lion was challenging the supremacy of his Lordship the Lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02040 " The Lion was naturally very enraged and asked to be taken to the location of the other Lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02041 " The wise rabbit agreed and led the Lion towards a deep well filled with water " )
( train_bengalifemale_02042 " Then he showed the Lion his reflection in the water of the well " )
( train_bengalifemale_02043 " The Lion was furious and started growling and naturally its image in the water the other Lion was also equally angry " )
( train_bengalifemale_02044 " Then the Lion jumped into the water at the other Lion to attack it and so lost its life in the well " )

( train_bengalifemale_02108 " The elders have always said that the stupid person who offers uncalled advice to the king invites not only insult but also deceit said Ram " )
( train_bengalifemale_02109 " No Shaam said anyone who serves the king with devotion is bound to earn his favour in the long run " )
( train_bengalifemale_02110 " The one who does not remain where he is " )
( train_bengalifemale_02111 " Those who understand why the king is angry or generous will one day rise in office " )
( train_bengalifemale_02112 " It is necessary to be in the good books of the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02113 " Okay what do you want to do now asked Ram " )
( train_bengalifemale_02114 " You know the king is scared now " )
( train_bengalifemale_02115 " We will ask him what frightens him and use the six ways of diplomacy to get close to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02116 " How do you know the king is scared " )
( train_bengalifemale_02117 " Changes in posture signs pace actions conversation looks and expression indicate the working of the mind " )
( train_bengalifemale_02118 " I will approach the fear struck king today and with my intelligence I will dispel his fear and once again become his minister said Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02119 " How can you do it when you do not know principles of service asked Ram " )
( train_bengalifemale_02120 " Shaam told him all he knew and learnt about what makes a good and loyal servant in the service of the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02121 " In that case I wish you all good luck said Ram " )
( train_bengalifemale_02122 " Taking leave of Ram Shaam then called on the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02123 " Recognizing that he was the son of his old minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_02124 " King Lion told his sentry to bring him into his presence " )
( train_bengalifemale_02125 " Shaam came down on his knees to pay respects to the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02126 " We haven't seen you for a long time the king said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02127 " I do not know of what use I can be to you my lord " )
( train_bengalifemale_02128 " Yet according to the learned there are occasions when every person however high or low will be of use to the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02129 " For generations we have served the king with devotion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02130 " Yet I am out of your majesty's favour " )
( train_bengalifemale_02131 " All right competent or incompetent you are the son of our old minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_02132 " Go ahead and tell me whatever you have in your mind the king ordered Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02133 " May I ask you humbly my lord what made you come back from the lake without drinking water asked Shaam reluctantly " )
( train_bengalifemale_02134 " Shaam haven't you heard the great and frightening sounds in the distance I want to leave this forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_02135 " The strange animal that could make such sounds ought to be as powerful as the sounds he makes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02136 " Your majesty if it is only sound that is your problem I wish to submit that sounds are misleading " )
( train_bengalifemale_02137 " I can tell you the story of the jackal how it overcame the fear of sound " )
( train_bengalifemale_02138 " Let us hear it said the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02139 " Here comes the story of a jackal and the drum " )
( train_bengalifemale_02140 " A hungry jackal set out in search of food and ended up at an abandoned battlefield when he heard loud and strange sounds " )
( train_bengalifemale_02141 " Scared he thought I must disappear from here before the man who is making these sounds gets me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02142 " After a while he told himself I must not run away like that " )
( train_bengalifemale_02143 " Let me find out what really the sounds are and who is making them because whether it is fear or happiness one must know its cause " )
( train_bengalifemale_02144 " Such a person will never regret his actions " )
( train_bengalifemale_02145 " So let me first look for the source of these noises " )
( train_bengalifemale_02146 " Warily the jackal marched in the direction of the sounds and found a drum there " )
( train_bengalifemale_02147 " It was this drum which was sending the sounds whenever the branches of the tree above brushed against it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02148 " Relieved the jackal began playing the drum and thought that there could be food inside it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02149 " The jackal entered the drum by piercing its side " )
( train_bengalifemale_02150 " He was disappointed to find no food in it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02151 " Yet he consoled himself saying that he rid himself of the fear of sound " )
( train_bengalifemale_02152 " Therefore Shaam told king Lion your majesty should not be afraid of sounds " )
( train_bengalifemale_02153 " I seek your permission to go and see what the sounds are Okay said the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02154 " Taking leave of the king Shaam proceeded in the direction of the sound " )
( train_bengalifemale_02155 " The king now began worrying himself about Shaam's intentions " )
( train_bengalifemale_02156 " He may have a grudge against me for dismissing him once " )
( train_bengalifemale_02157 " Such persons seek revenge I should not have taken him into confidence " )
( train_bengalifemale_02158 " Let me keep an eye on him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02159 " Wise men have always maintained that it is difficult to kill even a weak man who does not easily trust others but easy to kill a strong man who readily trusts others the king thought " )
( train_bengalifemale_02160 " As the king kept an eye on him Shaam moved slowly towards the bullock and found that he was after all an animal and thought This is a good omen " )
( train_bengalifemale_02161 " This will help me to get back into the good books of the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02162 " Kings never follow the advice of their ministers unless they are in peril or grief " )
( train_bengalifemale_02163 " Just as a healthy man never thinks of a doctor a strong and secure king also never remembers the need for a minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_02164 " Assured that what he saw was only a bullock Shaam returned to the king and told him what he saw " )
( train_bengalifemale_02165 " Is it true the king asked " )
( train_bengalifemale_02166 " The king is God The man who lies to a king perishes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02167 " He alone has the power to grant favours " )
( train_bengalifemale_02168 " I believe you Great men do not harm weaker people " )
( train_bengalifemale_02169 " They take on only their equals " )
( train_bengalifemale_02170 " That is what is unique about brave people " )
( train_bengalifemale_02171 " What your majesty says is true Bullock is great " )
( train_bengalifemale_02172 " If your lordship permits me I will persuade him to be one of your servants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02173 " All right I am taking you back as a minister said the king pleased " )
( train_bengalifemale_02174 " Shaam at once hurried back to Bullock and told him to stop bellowing and come and meet his king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02175 " But the bullock wanted to know who this Lion was " )
( train_bengalifemale_02176 " What You do not know our lord Wait you will know shortly the cost of this ignorance " )
( train_bengalifemale_02177 " There he is surrounded by his retinue under the banyan tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_02178 " Bullock thought his days were numbered and pleaded with Shaam Sir you seem to be a man of great wisdom and wit " )
( train_bengalifemale_02179 " You alone can save me I can come only if you can assure me that no harm will come to me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02180 " Shaam told the bullock to wait for the right time to meet the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02181 " Returning to the king Shaam told him My lord he is not an ordinary being " )
( train_bengalifemale_02182 " He is the vehicle of Lord Shiva " )
( train_bengalifemale_02183 " He told me that Lord Shiva had permitted him to feed on the tender grass in the neighbourhood of Jamuna " )
( train_bengalifemale_02184 " But I told him that the forest belonged to our lion king who is the vehicle of goddess Paarvathi " )
( train_bengalifemale_02185 " You are our guest You can see our king and seek a separate space for you to graze " )
( train_bengalifemale_02186 " He agreed to this plan provided he has an assurance from your majesty " )
( train_bengalifemale_02187 " Yes certainly But I will need assurance from him in return " )
( train_bengalifemale_02188 " Bring him here the king told Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02189 " Going back to the bullock Shaam advised him You have the assurance of the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02190 " But this new position should not go to your head " )
( train_bengalifemale_02191 " We have to work together That is how we can prosper " )
( train_bengalifemale_02192 " Otherwise he who does not respect everyone however high or low will forfeit the favour of kings like that Chandran " )
( train_bengalifemale_02193 " What about Chandran asked Bullock " )
( train_bengalifemale_02194 " In the city of Merchant there lived a wealthy merchant named Chandran " )
( train_bengalifemale_02195 " He held a great reception for his wedding attended by the king the queen their ministers and all the rich and influential persons in the city " )
( train_bengalifemale_02196 " Present at the reception was a lowly sweeper in the royal household " )
( train_bengalifemale_02197 " When Chandran saw him occupying a seat reserved for the nobles of the king he ordered his servants to throw him out of his house " )
( train_bengalifemale_02198 " Thus insulted sweeper thought to himself I am a poor man and so cannot give a fitting reply to such a wealthy person as Chandran " )
( train_bengalifemale_02199 " I must somehow see that the king stops his favours to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02200 " Then he hit upon a plan to take revenge on Chandran " )
( train_bengalifemale_02201 " One early morning when the king was still in sleep sweeper pretending to sweep the king's bedroom began murmer loudly " )
( train_bengalifemale_02202 " He murmured how arrogant is Chandran He has the cheek to lock the queen in his embrace " )
( train_bengalifemale_02203 " Hearing this the king demanded to know whether what the sweeper was murmuring was true " )
( train_bengalifemale_02204 " Did Chandran embrace the queen your majesty I do not remember nor do I know what I was saying " )
( train_bengalifemale_02205 " Because I was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling the sweeper told the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02206 " Not satisfied with his reply the king thought that it was possible that the sweeper had seen Chandran who had equal access to the royal household as this sweeper embracing the queen " )
( train_bengalifemale_02207 " He remembered wise men saying that men were likely to talk in their sleep about what they did saw and desired in the day " )
( train_bengalifemale_02208 " Women were chaste because men were not within reach or they were afraid of prying servants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02209 " Convinced that Chandran had indeed embraced the queen the king barred Chandran from entering the royal household " )
( train_bengalifemale_02210 " The merchant began grieving his fate though he had not done any harm to the king or his relatives even in his dreams " )
( train_bengalifemale_02211 " One day as Chandran was trying to enter the king's palace he was barred by the king's men " )
( train_bengalifemale_02212 " Seeing this the sweeper told them You fools you are barring the great Chandran who has won the king's favours " )
( train_bengalifemale_02213 " He is powerful If you stop him you will never meet with the same fate as I did at the hands of Chandran one day " )
( train_bengalifemale_02214 " The merchant thought that it would do him good to make sweeper happy and win his confidence " )
( train_bengalifemale_02215 " One evening he invited the sweeper for tea and presented him with expensive clothes and told him Friend I had never meant to insult you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02216 " You had occupied a seat I had set apart for the learned " )
( train_bengalifemale_02217 " Kindly pardon me Pleased the sweeper promised to win the king's favour for Chandran again " )
( train_bengalifemale_02218 " The next day sweeper repeated the same drama of pretending to talk irrelevantly raving that the king was eating cucumber in the rest room " )
( train_bengalifemale_02219 " What nonsense are you talking Did you ever see me doing such things the king demanded to know " )
( train_bengalifemale_02220 " No your majesty I do not know nor do I remember what I was saying " )
( train_bengalifemale_02221 " Because I was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling the sweeper said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02222 " The king then realized that if what the sweeper had said about him was not true what he had said about Chandran also could not be true " )
( train_bengalifemale_02223 " A person like Chandran could not have done what sweeper had told him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02224 " The king also found that without Chandran the affairs of the state had suffered and civic administration had come to a standstill " )
( train_bengalifemale_02225 " The king immediately summoned the merchant to his palace and restored to him all the authority he had enjoyed before he fell out of king's favour " )
( train_bengalifemale_02226 " Shaam resumed That is why we must know that pride goes before fall " )
( train_bengalifemale_02227 " Bullock agreed Taking him to the lion king Shaam introduced Bullock to Lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02228 " After exchanging pleasantries the king asked him to relate his past and the purpose of staying in that jungle " )
( train_bengalifemale_02229 " On the bullock relating his story the king said Friend do not be afraid " )
( train_bengalifemale_02230 " I assure you that I will protect you from wild animals here because even stronger animals feel insecure here " )
( train_bengalifemale_02231 " Since then the king asked Ram and Shaam to look after the affairs of the state and began happily spending his time in the company of Bullock " )
( train_bengalifemale_02232 " But the jackals were worried that after Bullock had become a good friend of the king the king gave up his royal sports and pastime and became a saint " )
( train_bengalifemale_02233 " The jackal twins thought the king has stopped taking us into confidence after Bullock became his best friend " )
( train_bengalifemale_02234 " He is also indifferent to his kingly duties " )
( train_bengalifemale_02235 " What shall we do now Ram said The king may not heed our advice " )
( train_bengalifemale_02236 " But it is our duty to advise him on it if it is good for him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02237 " Elders have always held that even if the king is not willing to heed good advice it is the duty of his ministers to offer him advice " )
( train_bengalifemale_02238 " You are right said Shaam The mistake is mine " )
( train_bengalifemale_02239 " What happened to the sage and the jackal should not happen to us " )
( train_bengalifemale_02240 " Ram then asked him to tell the story of the sage and the jackal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02241 " Shaam began telling him the story of a foolish sage and the jackal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02242 " In a monastery far away from human habitation lived a saint called Deva Sharma " )
( train_bengalifemale_02243 " He amassed a lot of wealth by selling clothes gifted to him by well-wishers and disciples " )
( train_bengalifemale_02244 " It became a burden for him to guard that wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02245 " Since he did not trust anyone he put all his money into a bag and carried it with him wherever he went " )
( train_bengalifemale_02246 " Komal an experienced cheat noticed Deva Sharma carrying his bag always with him and assuming that it certainly contained something valuable began planning to snatch it from him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02247 " One day the cheat met the saint and promptly fell on his feet and said know all I have realized that this life is an illusion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02248 " Youth is fleeting and all familial ties are like a dream " )
( train_bengalifemale_02249 " Please show me the correct path that delivers me from all worldly ties " )
( train_bengalifemale_02250 " Pleased with his humility Deva Sharma said Child you are the blessed one who has thought of renouncing worldly pleasures " )
( train_bengalifemale_02251 " Listen however low his caste is the person that chants and smears holy ash on his forehead becomes Siva himself and knows no rebirth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02252 " I shall accept you as my portage but you must not enter the hermitage in the night because company is forbidden for saints " )
( train_bengalifemale_02253 " After initiation you have to live in the hut at the entrance of the monastery " )
( train_bengalifemale_02254 " Komal promised the saint that he would consider every sign from him as a command and carry it out " )
( train_bengalifemale_02255 " Satisfied the saint accepted the cheat as his disciple " )
( train_bengalifemale_02256 " Komal too began making Deva Sharma happy by attending to every need of his " )
( train_bengalifemale_02257 " But seeing that the saint never separated the money bag from his person Komal thought the old man is very crafty and keeps the bag always with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02258 " How can I snatch it from him Shall I kill him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02259 " As the cheat was at a loss to achieve his goal the son of a disciple came calling on the sage " )
( train_bengalifemale_02260 " The visitor invited Deva Sharma to come to his village and perform the sacred thread ceremony of his son " )
( train_bengalifemale_02261 " The saint accepted the invitation and set out for the village taking Komal with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02262 " On the way the guru and his disciple had to cross a river " )
( train_bengalifemale_02263 " After bathing in the river and wanting to rest for a while Deva Sharma took the money bag " )
( train_bengalifemale_02264 " He pushed it into a quilt he was carrying and told the disciple I have to respond to nature's call " )
( train_bengalifemale_02265 " I am leaving this holy quilt of Siva here Keep an eye on it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02266 " The moment the guru went out of his sight Komal collected the bag and fled the place " )
( train_bengalifemale_02267 " With great trust in his disciple Deva Sharma decided to spend time by joining a crowd watching two well fed goats fighting ferociously " )
( train_bengalifemale_02268 " As blood was running down their heads a jackal came there to feast on the blood the two goats were shedding " )
( train_bengalifemale_02269 " Deva Sharma saw the jackal entering the scene and thought that the jackal would surely die caught between the two warring goats " )
( train_bengalifemale_02270 " Brooding over the demise of the jackal Deva Sharma returned to where he had left the money bag with Komal and panicked when he found Komal missing " )
( train_bengalifemale_02271 " The holy quilt was there but not the money bag in it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02272 " After a vain search for the trickster the foolish saint returned home dejected " )
( train_bengalifemale_02273 " Shaam asked Ram What do you learn from this episode You alone can tell me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02274 " The sage and the jackal have none to blame except themselves " )
( train_bengalifemale_02275 " In a similar situation what should we do Shaam said Yes I know what to do now " )
( train_bengalifemale_02276 " Haven't you heard that though you cannot subdue the enemy with a volley of arrows you can destroy him by your Wait said Ram " )
( train_bengalifemale_02277 " Suppose the lion king and the roving bullock come to know of your plans to separate them get ready to meet your end " )
( train_bengalifemale_02278 " When time and tide are against you do not give up " )
( train_bengalifemale_02279 " Wise men keep on trying till they succeed in getting what they want " )
( train_bengalifemale_02280 " Haven't you heard the elders saying The Goddess of Wealth favours the man who persists " )
( train_bengalifemale_02281 " Pray God by all means but put in your own effort " )
( train_bengalifemale_02282 " Even if you do not succeed you will be free of blame " )
( train_bengalifemale_02283 " Ram was not convinced that Shaam could create rift between the fierce lion king and the wise bullock " )
( train_bengalifemale_02284 " Shaam told him Here is how through cunning two crows husband and wife managed to save their children from a cobra " )
( train_bengalifemale_02285 " Every time the wife hatched the eggs a cobra would come and feast on the offspring " )
( train_bengalifemale_02286 " The couple asked a jackal who was their friend to show them the way " )
( train_bengalifemale_02287 " The jackal told the crow not to despair for there is nothing that a trick cannot achieve " )
( train_bengalifemale_02288 " That is how a crab killed a greedy crane that was preying on the fish in the lake " )
( train_bengalifemale_02289 " The female crow asked the jackal how the crab had killed the crane " )
( train_bengalifemale_02290 " The jackal narrated that story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02291 " Then the crows asked the jackal how they could get rid of the cobra that was feasting on their offspring " )
( train_bengalifemale_02292 " The jackal told them to go to a big city and snatch any item of jewellery from a palace and drop it in the hollow of the tree that is the cobra's home " )
( train_bengalifemale_02293 " In search of the jewellery the king's men would reach the tree and kill the cobra " )
( train_bengalifemale_02294 " The crow couple flew off to a lake where the women revealing in the water is the Queen " )
( train_bengalifemale_02295 " Before entering the water the women left their jewellery and clothes on the waterside " )
( train_bengalifemale_02296 " The female crow skillfully dived and snatched a gold necklace and began slowly flying towards the cobra's hideout " )
( train_bengalifemale_02297 " The king's men who saw the crow fly off with the necklace followed the female crow and saw it dropping the necklace into the hollow of the tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_02298 " They ran to the tree and pulling it out killed the cobra " )
( train_bengalifemale_02299 " That's why Shaam told Ram elders say that he who is wise is stronger than the strong " )
( train_bengalifemale_02300 " Shaam resumed This is how with my skills I will create a rift between Lion and Bullock " )
( train_bengalifemale_02301 " All right best of luck to you said Ram " )
( train_bengalifemale_02302 " One day when Lion was alone Shaam visited him and bowed to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02303 " We haven't seen you for a long time said Lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02304 " Of what use am I to you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02305 " Yet when your rule is breaking up I thought I should inform you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02306 " Even without asking offer good advice to him whom you want to protect from indignity said our elders " )
( train_bengalifemale_02307 " Gathering courage Shaam said My lord Bullock wants to harm you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02308 " Taking me into confidence he once told me that he would kill you become the king and make me a minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_02309 " But Bullock is a trusted friend of mine " )
( train_bengalifemale_02310 " Why should he think of harming me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02311 " There is no loyal or disloyal servant " )
( train_bengalifemale_02312 " There is no servant who does not covet power " )
( train_bengalifemale_02313 " My lord what made you to take Bullock into confidence think he is a strong animal able to kill your enemies " )
( train_bengalifemale_02314 " This will not happen because he is a vegetarian and my lord feasts on meat " )
( train_bengalifemale_02315 " It is better to get rid of him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02316 " You remember I gave him the word on your advice " )
( train_bengalifemale_02317 " How can I kill him who has won assurance from me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02318 " My lord according to wise men you should not make friends with people you do not know " )
( train_bengalifemale_02319 " You know how an innocent flea died for the fault of a bug " )
( train_bengalifemale_02320 " Lion demanded to know the story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02321 " Shaam began to relate The Bug and The Poor Flea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02322 " Once upon a time a bug made for itself a small home in the folds of the milk white sheets of linen spread on the king's ornamental bed " )
( train_bengalifemale_02323 " One day the bug saw a flea drifting into the king's bedroom " )
( train_bengalifemale_02324 " The bug told the flea that he had come to a wrong place " )
( train_bengalifemale_02325 " It also asked him to leave before somebody noticed him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02326 " You must welcome him ask him about his health say words that comfort him and request him to take rest " )
( train_bengalifemale_02327 " That is how good hosts treat their guests " )
( train_bengalifemale_02328 " Besides I have tasted the blood of a variety of men and animals " )
( train_bengalifemale_02329 " Never did I taste royal blood " )
( train_bengalifemale_02330 " The king's blood is a compound of rich foods and is bound to taste rich " )
( train_bengalifemale_02331 " Please permit me to relish this delicacy " )
( train_bengalifemale_02332 " The flea continued Everything we do in this world we do to slake our hunger " )
( train_bengalifemale_02333 " I have come to you in search of food " )
( train_bengalifemale_02334 " It is not proper for you to siphon off the king's blood all alone " )
( train_bengalifemale_02335 " You should share it with me also " )
( train_bengalifemale_02336 " The bug told him flea I suck the blood of the king when he is fast asleep " )
( train_bengalifemale_02337 " You are impatient You have to wait till I finish my job " )
( train_bengalifemale_02338 " After me you can have your fill " )
( train_bengalifemale_02339 " The flea agreed Meanwhile the king entered his bedroom to sleep " )
( train_bengalifemale_02340 " But the impatient flea began feasting on the king's blood even before he went to sleep " )
( train_bengalifemale_02341 " Stung by his bite the king rose from his bed and asked his servants to look for what was in the bed that caused him discomfort " )

( train_bengalifemale_02374 " He told me today that he would kill you tomorrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02375 " If you notice him carefully tomorrow you will find him red eyed and occupying a seat he does not deserve " )

( train_bengalifemale_02383 " They know no sleep no interest in food nor can they speak without fear " )
( train_bengalifemale_02384 " Yet they live Somebody has rightly compared service to a dog's life said Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02385 " Come to the point my friend The bullock was now impatient " )

( train_bengalifemale_02393 " I told the king that this was stabbing a friend in the back Shaam continued " )
( train_bengalifemale_02394 " The king was angry and said that you were a vegetarian and he lived on a diet of meat " )
( train_bengalifemale_02395 " So there was natural discord between you and him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02396 " He said that this was enough reason for him to kill you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02397 " This is a secret I have kept to myself for a long time " )
( train_bengalifemale_02398 " It is now for you to do what is necessary " )
( train_bengalifemale_02399 " Bullock fainted on hearing these words " )
( train_bengalifemale_02400 " Recovering after some time he said It is truly said that a person who serves the king is like a bullock without horns " )
( train_bengalifemale_02401 " It is difficult to know the mind of a king who has different ideas " )
( train_bengalifemale_02402 " It is not easy to serve a king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02403 " Even sages could not read the minds of kings " )
( train_bengalifemale_02404 " I think some servants who were jealous of my friendship with the king must have poisoned his mind " )
( train_bengalifemale_02405 " Do not worry Shaam said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02406 " Forget what tales the servants carried to the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02407 " You can still win his favour by your sweet words " )
( train_bengalifemale_02408 " That is not true It is impossible to live with wicked people however small they are " )
( train_bengalifemale_02409 " Sounds interesting Let me know what happened to the camel asked Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02410 " Bullock began to tell him the story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02411 " The story of a camel a jackal and the crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02412 " Once in a far off forest there lived a lion named Leo served by a leopard a jackal and a crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02413 " One day they sighted a camel who lost his way " )
( train_bengalifemale_02414 " Thinking the camel they saw was an unusual animal the lion asked his assistants to find out if he was a wild animal or domestic animal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02415 " The crow said that the camel was a domestic animal fit to be killed and eaten " )
( train_bengalifemale_02416 " According to our elders you cannot kill even an enemy who came trusting you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02417 " He who kills so commits the sin of killing hundred Brahmins " )
( train_bengalifemale_02418 " Assure him of safety and bring him to me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02419 " The three assistants brought the camel to the presence of the lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02420 " On the lion asking the camel to relate his story Camel told him how he was part of a trade caravan and how he had lost his way " )
( train_bengalifemale_02421 " The lion told the camel Camel why do you go back to your village and become once again a beast of burden " )
( train_bengalifemale_02422 " Remain with us without any hesitation and feast on this tender grass " )
( train_bengalifemale_02423 " Thereafter the camel stayed on to live happily with the lion and his three assistants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02424 " One day the lion was locked in a battle with an elephant " )
( train_bengalifemale_02425 " The tusker gored Leo and badly injured him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02426 " He became too weak to hunt " )
( train_bengalifemale_02427 " Without food he was in no position to do anything " )
( train_bengalifemale_02428 " Then the lion asked the assistants to go out and look for some animal for his meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02429 " Bring the animal here I will kill him somehow and provide food for you all said the lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02430 " The leopard the jackal and the camel looked everywhere for an animal but could not find anyone " )
( train_bengalifemale_02431 " The jackal told the crow aside " )
( train_bengalifemale_02432 " Friend what is the use of wasting time like this We have Camel our lord's loyal friend " )
( train_bengalifemale_02433 " Let us kill him and survive " )
( train_bengalifemale_02434 " That is fine Yet we cannot kill him because our lord has assured him protection said the crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02435 " Leave it to me I shall convince Leo to kill the camel Wait here " )
( train_bengalifemale_02436 " I will meet the lord and get his permission said the jackal and left to meet the lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02437 " The jackal told his lord lord we went to every nook and corner of the forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_02438 " We could not find a single animal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02439 " We are tired weak and hungry " )
( train_bengalifemale_02440 " Since my lord is also in the same condition I humbly suggest that we make a meal of this camel " )
( train_bengalifemale_02441 " Highly annoyed the lion said You sinner if you repeat these words I shall first kill you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02442 " Haven't our elders said that no gift of land or cow or food is greater than the gift of an assurance " )
( train_bengalifemale_02443 " You are right my lord It is a sin to kill him who has your word " )
( train_bengalifemale_02444 " But if the camel voluntarily offers himself as food it is no sin to accept the offer " )
( train_bengalifemale_02445 " If he does not volunteer you can kill anyone of us " )
( train_bengalifemale_02446 " You are hungry and close to your end " )
( train_bengalifemale_02447 " If we are not of use to you at this time what value have our lives If anything undesirable happens to our lord we will immolate ourselves " )
( train_bengalifemale_02448 " This seems to be more reasonable said the lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02449 " The jackal told the other two assistants Friends our lord is in a pitiable condition " )
( train_bengalifemale_02450 " Instead of aimlessly searching the forest for food let us offer our bodies to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02451 " That will deliver us from the burden of debt " )
( train_bengalifemale_02452 " After the jackal's plea all of them called on the lion with tears in their eyes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02453 " What's the matter Did you find an animal asked the lion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02454 " No my lord We searched every place every inch of the forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_02455 " We are not lucky We found nothing " )
( train_bengalifemale_02456 " But I request the lord to have me for his meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02457 " The lord will survive and I will go to heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_02458 " He who lays down his life to save his lord will have no rebirth said the crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02459 " It was now the turn of the jackal to show his loyalty " )
( train_bengalifemale_02460 " He said My friend crow Your body is too small to slake the hunger of my lord " )
( train_bengalifemale_02461 " It amounts to starving him and that is a sin " )
( train_bengalifemale_02462 " Get out of my way I have to submit a plea to my lord " )
( train_bengalifemale_02463 " Addressing the lion the jackal said Lord I request you to have me for your meal and ensure me a place in heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_02464 " The lord has rights of life and death over his servants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02465 " Therefore it is no sin in exercising his rights " )
( train_bengalifemale_02466 " The leopard intervened and said You jackal you are no great personality " )
( train_bengalifemale_02467 " Let me plead with the lord " )
( train_bengalifemale_02468 " Addressing Leo the leopard said lord let me give away my life to save your life " )
( train_bengalifemale_02469 " Please permit me to earn a permanent berth in heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_02470 " My sacrifice will win fame for me on earth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02471 " All this set Camel thinking All these servants of the lord have said what they wanted to say " )
( train_bengalifemale_02472 " Still the lion did not kill anyone of them " )
( train_bengalifemale_02473 " Let me also offer to be the lord's food today " )
( train_bengalifemale_02474 " I am sure my friends will support me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02475 " He then turned to the leopard and said What you have said is right and proper " )
( train_bengalifemale_02476 " How can he kill you Let me offer myself " )
( train_bengalifemale_02477 " The camel then came forward and requested the lion to have him for that day's meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02478 " At once the jackal and the leopard pounced on him tore him to pieces and all of them had a sumptuous feast " )
( train_bengalifemale_02479 " As the story ended Bullock told Shaam Wicked people surround the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02480 " Good men should not serve such masters " )
( train_bengalifemale_02481 " I will need your advice to get out of this problem " )
( train_bengalifemale_02482 " The best course is to leave the country said Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02483 " It is not wise to leave when the king is still angry " )
( train_bengalifemale_02484 " Chandrayaan-1 was sent to the Moon in a series of orbit-increasing manoeuvres around the Earth over a period of 21 days as opposed to launching the craft on a direct trajectory to the Moon. " )
( train_bengalifemale_02485 " The only alternative I have is to go to war with the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02486 " Shaam was afraid that if Bullock chose to fight Lion the lion might die and that would be a disaster " )
( train_bengalifemale_02487 " Let me persuade the bullock to leave the forest he thought Going to war is all right " )
( train_bengalifemale_02488 " If you underestimate the strength of your enemy you will meet the same fate as the Sea met at the hands of the bird pair " )
( train_bengalifemale_02489 " Curious bullock asked What happened to the birds " )
( train_bengalifemale_02490 " This is a story about a bird pair and the sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02491 " Once upon a time a pair of pheasants lived close to the Sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02492 " They spent their time happily singing and dancing on the branches of the trees by the Sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02493 " One day the female pheasant told her husband that she was expecting their baby and he must look for a safe place to lay the eggs " )
( train_bengalifemale_02494 " The husband said My dear this Seaside is enchanting and it is better you lay eggs here only " )
( train_bengalifemale_02495 " The wife said When it is full moon the Sea tide can wash away even wild elephants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02496 " Let us go elsewhere Amused the husband said What you say is true " )
( train_bengalifemale_02497 " But the Sea has no power to harm us " )
( train_bengalifemale_02498 " Haven't you heard that there is no fool who could stop the flight of a bird or a fool who would enter fire recklessly " )
( train_bengalifemale_02499 " Will anyone be brash enough to challenge Yama the Lord of Death to take his life if he can " )
( train_bengalifemale_02500 " You can lay your eggs here only " )
( train_bengalifemale_02501 " Listening to this dialogue the Sea thought How vain is this bird which is as small as a worm " )
( train_bengalifemale_02502 " Let me drown these eggs and see what he can do " )
( train_bengalifemale_02503 " After laying eggs the female bird went in search of food " )
( train_bengalifemale_02504 " In her absence the Sea sent a wave that sucked the eggs into the waters " )
( train_bengalifemale_02505 " The female returned to the nest and not finding the eggs there told the husband You are a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_02506 " I told you that the waves would wash away the eggs " )
( train_bengalifemale_02507 " Those who do not heed the good words of a friend will perish like the turtle who fell off the stick " )
( train_bengalifemale_02508 " What's that turtle and what is that stick asked the husband " )
( train_bengalifemale_02509 " Once upon a time a turtle lived in a pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_02510 " He had two swans Sankat and Vikat as good friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_02511 " Every day they would meet on the rim of the pond and discuss legends of yore " )
( train_bengalifemale_02512 " They would disperse with sunset " )
( train_bengalifemale_02513 " That year there were no rains and the water in the pond began slowly disappearing " )
( train_bengalifemale_02514 " Worried the swans told the turtle Friend What will happen to you We are concerned " )
( train_bengalifemale_02515 " I appreciate your interest in me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02516 " There is trouble ahead " )
( train_bengalifemale_02517 " Please find a way out of this crisis But it is important that we should not give in to despair " )
( train_bengalifemale_02518 " According to turtle all good men should come to the rescue of friends and relatives in times of need " )
( train_bengalifemale_02519 " Look for a stick or a rope " )
( train_bengalifemale_02520 " I will hang on to it as both of you hold the two sides of the stick or rope and ferry me to safety " )
( train_bengalifemale_02521 " We shall do as you say the swans said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02522 " But you have to shut your mouth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02523 " Otherwise you will crash to the ground " )
( train_bengalifemale_02524 " On the turtle agreeing to the plan the swans brought a stick and asked the turtle to hold it with his teeth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02525 " When everything was ready the swans flew off with the turtle hanging from it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02526 " On the way people saw this sight and exclaimed see how clever the birds are " )
( train_bengalifemale_02527 " In trying to respond to the people the turtle opened his mouth and fell to the ground and died " )
( train_bengalifemale_02528 " The people blamed at his stupid action and dispersed " )
( train_bengalifemale_02529 " The lesson is that those who do not heed the advice of their well wishers meet their end like the turtle " )
( train_bengalifemale_02530 " Any day the survivors are those who foresee a danger in time and those who deal with it when it comes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02531 " Those who leave things to fate and believe in luck will destroy themselves like Raj said the female pheasant " )
( train_bengalifemale_02532 " What happened to Raj asked the male bird " )
( train_bengalifemale_02533 " The tale of the three fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_02534 " Once upon a time three fish lived in a pond " )

( train_bengalifemale_02536 " Some fishermen passing by the pond wondered we have never seen this pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_02537 " It seems to be full of fish It is now evening " )
( train_bengalifemale_02538 " Let us come at dawn tomorrow and bag as many fish as we can " )
( train_bengalifemale_02539 " He told them Haven't you heard what the fishermen were saying " )
( train_bengalifemale_02540 " We must move out of this pond tonight itself " )
( train_bengalifemale_02541 " As the wise men have said weak men should flee when a strong man invades or seek refuge in a fort " )
( train_bengalifemale_02542 " There is no alternative The fisherman will come tomorrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02543 " I think we should not be here for even a moment more said Kumar " )
( train_bengalifemale_02544 " That's true I endorse your suggestion said Ravi " )
( train_bengalifemale_02545 " Let's go elsewhere Those who are afraid of foreign lands and those who are bound to their soil will die in their own country " )
( train_bengalifemale_02546 " He who can prosper anywhere does not die in his own land clinging to sentiment " )
( train_bengalifemale_02547 " Loudly laughing Raj said Your plans are not good " )
( train_bengalifemale_02548 " Why should we leave this pond ancient home of our forefathers because the fishermen have evil intentions " )
( train_bengalifemale_02549 " If it is destined we cannot escape death even if we go elsewhere " )
( train_bengalifemale_02550 " Everything is in the hands of God " )
( train_bengalifemale_02551 " You cannot dispose what he proposes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02552 " Without his blessings people will die even if they have protection " )
( train_bengalifemale_02553 " With his blessings nobody can kill them even if they do not have protection " )
( train_bengalifemale_02554 " Coming the next day the fishermen took a big catch of fish in the pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_02555 " Raj was one among them in the net " )
( train_bengalifemale_02556 " The female pheasant resumed That is why I told you that those who foresee the problem and those who deal with the problem when it arises are always victors " )
( train_bengalifemale_02557 " Her husband asked In that case do you think I am as stupid as that Raj " )
( train_bengalifemale_02558 " Wait and see what I can do " )
( train_bengalifemale_02559 " I will siphon off all the water in the Sea and leave him dry " )
( train_bengalifemale_02560 " Do not try to settle scores with the Sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02561 " It will do no good to you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02562 " A weak man's anger will hurt him in the end " )
( train_bengalifemale_02563 " Do not discourage me Those who have confidence can confront stronger men " )
( train_bengalifemale_02564 " Doesn't the lion who is small in size slash the crown of the mighty elephant " )

( train_bengalifemale_02566 " See how I will siphon off all the water in the Sea and make him dry said the male " )
( train_bengalifemale_02567 " But hundreds of rivers flow into the sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02568 " Your beak is just as big as a drop of the sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02569 " How can you consume all the water in the Sea Stop this tall talk advised the female " )
( train_bengalifemale_02570 " Not to despair is to win the Goddess of Wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02571 " I have an iron beak " )
( train_bengalifemale_02572 " I will toil day and night to siphon of all the water " )
( train_bengalifemale_02573 " The wife said Okay if you want to engage the Sea call all of your friends and try to do the job together " )
( train_bengalifemale_02574 " When they are united it is difficult to defeat even a band of weak men " )
( train_bengalifemale_02575 " Even blades of slender grass can bind an elephant if they are woven into a rope " )
( train_bengalifemale_02576 " Haven't you heard the story of how a sparrow a woodpecker a fly and a frog killed an elephant " )

( train_bengalifemale_02584 " He moved by her grief asked her Why are you crying my friend " )
( train_bengalifemale_02585 " Wise men do not grieve what is lost or what is dead or what is past " )
( train_bengalifemale_02586 " That is the difference between a learned person and an unlettered man " )
( train_bengalifemale_02587 " The female sparrow said The wicked elephant has destroyed my offspring " )
( train_bengalifemale_02588 " If you are a true friend of mine suggest a way to kill him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02589 " In my view he who harms a person in trouble or he who ridicules a person in sorrow deserves to be punished and he who punishes such a person has no rebirth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02590 " What you say is right said the woodpecker " )
( train_bengalifemale_02591 " He is a friend who comes to your aid when you are in need " )

( train_bengalifemale_02648 " Shaam said He stares at you in anger if he has evil thoughts in his mind " )

( train_bengalifemale_02675 " Shaam continued That is why I told you that a wise man protects his interest even if it is to torment others and never shares his secrets with others as the jackal did in the above story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02676 " Bullock began pondering Why did I do like this " )
( train_bengalifemale_02677 " A vegetarian serving a meat eater " )

( train_bengalifemale_02686 " Bullock too began goring the lion with his horns " )
( train_bengalifemale_02687 " You fool You have created a rift between the two friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_02688 " If the lord dies how can you be a minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_02689 " How do you aspire to be a minister when you do not know the principles of diplomacy " )
( train_bengalifemale_02690 " War mongers like you can never reach their goals " )

( train_bengalifemale_02700 " In the court I have always praised Bullock " )
( train_bengalifemale_02701 " How can I explain his death to the courtiers Shaam approached the grief stricken king and told him lord ruing the death of a grass eater is cowardice " )
( train_bengalifemale_02702 " It is not good for a king like you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02703 " The learned have always said that it is not a sin to kill a person for the reason even if that person is a father brother son wife or a friend " )
( train_bengalifemale_02704 " Shaam continued You are mourning the death of someone who does not deserve sympathy " )
( train_bengalifemale_02705 " Though you are talking like a learned man you forget that learned men do not think of the past or the dead " )
( train_bengalifemale_02706 " These words of Shaam worked like a tonic providing relief to Lion's troubled mind " )
( train_bengalifemale_02707 " Then the two foxes sat on discussing many worldly wise stories " )
( train_bengalifemale_02708 " Ram blamed Shaam for his action and said You have the example of the bird " )
( train_bengalifemale_02709 " I am eager to know what it is said Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02710 " The story of the bird and The monkey " )
( train_bengalifemale_02711 " A gang of monkeys made their home in a mountain slope " )
( train_bengalifemale_02712 " When winter came it brought not only severe cold but also heavy rains " )
( train_bengalifemale_02713 " Unable to stand the cold the monkey collected red berries wildly growing in the mountain slope " )
( train_bengalifemale_02714 " They gathered around the berries and began blowing air at them thinking they were embers " )
( train_bengalifemale_02715 " Watching their vain effort in amusement a bird told them You fools they are not embers but red berries " )
( train_bengalifemale_02716 " Why do you waste your energy on them This will not save you from cold " )
( train_bengalifemale_02717 " Go and look for a shelter in a cave or a place free from wind " )
( train_bengalifemale_02718 " The clouds are thick and there will be no immediate relief from rain " )
( train_bengalifemale_02719 " Haven't the elders said that he who cherishes his welfare should not talk to a gambler or an inefficient workman " )
( train_bengalifemale_02720 " So is the person a fool who talks to an idiot or a pleasure seeker " )
( train_bengalifemale_02721 " Disregarding the old monkey's anger and not giving room to any other monkey to talk " )
( train_bengalifemale_02722 " The bird went on repeating his advice to them to seek shelter elsewhere " )
( train_bengalifemale_02723 " Tired with the bird's unwanted advice one of the monkey sprang at the bird and bashed him against a rock till he was dead " )
( train_bengalifemale_02724 " Ram said at the end of the story If you counsel a fool it will only provoke him and not pacify " )
( train_bengalifemale_02725 " If you feed milk to a snake it will increase its store of poison " )
( train_bengalifemale_02726 " That is why you should not offer advice to anyone " )
( train_bengalifemale_02727 " Look how two good sparrows lost their home all due to a foolish monkey " )
( train_bengalifemale_02728 " At Shaam's request Ram began telling the story of the evil monkey " )
( train_bengalifemale_02729 " Fools ignore advice and wise men follow it and benefit by it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02730 " It is clear that you haven't heard the story of dharma and his Son the story of how the father was killed by smoke due to the son's thoughtlessness " )
( train_bengalifemale_02731 " Why don't you tell me that story asked Shaam " )
( train_bengalifemale_02732 " In a city in the north lived two friends named dharma and Karan " )
( train_bengalifemale_02733 " One day Karan thought I am a man without worldly wisdom and added to that I am also poor " )
( train_bengalifemale_02734 " Let me persuade Dharma to take me to far off lands and earn lots of money through his business skills " )
( train_bengalifemale_02735 " Later I will deprive him of all his wealth and live happily ever after " )
( train_bengalifemale_02736 " With these plans on his mind Karan told Dharma My friend you are growing old and cannot manage your business " )
( train_bengalifemale_02737 " Unless you go out into the wide world how can you tell your children about the wonders of the world " )
( train_bengalifemale_02738 " Elders have said that he is born in vain who does not see the countries in the world, learn several languages and know the dress styles of other people " )
( train_bengalifemale_02739 " You cannot earn wealth and knowledge without wide travel " )
( train_bengalifemale_02740 " Dharma liked this advice and taking the blessings of his teachers set out on an overseas travel, taking Karan with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02741 " Both of them earned a lot of money abroad due to the business talent of Dharma " )
( train_bengalifemale_02742 " It was time for them to return home because it is natural for people who go abroad in search of wealth and learning to think of home when they have achieved both " )
( train_bengalifemale_02743 " As they were entering their native place, Karan told Dharma, It is not safe to take home all this wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02744 " Because relatives and friends in need will seek help if they know about our riches " )
( train_bengalifemale_02745 " We shall bury most of our money in some secret place in this forest " )
( train_bengalifemale_02746 " Dharma agreed to Karan's plan and went home after both of them dug a pit and covered it after burying most of their earnings in it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02747 " At once Karan began shouting loudly, Dharma, you stole the money and nobody else " )
( train_bengalifemale_02748 " The pit was carefully covered " )
( train_bengalifemale_02749 " You must give me half of what we have buried here " )
( train_bengalifemale_02750 " Though Dharma denied it, Karan insisted that they should take the dispute to a court of law " )
( train_bengalifemale_02751 " When the case came before the court, the judge asked them to take oath in the name of God " )
( train_bengalifemale_02752 " But Karan quoted experts as saying that relevant documents should be produced first as proof " )
( train_bengalifemale_02753 " I can produce the gods of the forest as witnesses " )
( train_bengalifemale_02754 " They will determine who is guilty and who is innocent, said Karan " )
( train_bengalifemale_02755 " Impressed by this plan, the judges asked both the parties to be present next morning at the forest for a hearing " )
( train_bengalifemale_02756 " Happy at the judges' order, Karan went home and told his father, Father, I have stolen all Dharma's money " )
( train_bengalifemale_02757 " There is a case in the court that I can win only with your help " )
( train_bengalifemale_02758 " What have I to do to get that money, son, asked his father " )
( train_bengalifemale_02759 " There is a big tree there " )
( train_bengalifemale_02760 " Tomorrow morning when the judges and others assemble there, I will ask you to tell the truth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02761 " The morning of the next day, the son took a bath and went to the tree taking Dharma and the judges with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02762 " Karan went near the tree and shouted, sun, moon, air, fire, earth, water, the God of Death, day and night, you are all witnesses to the history of humanity " )
( train_bengalifemale_02763 " Goddess of the Forest, declare who among us is guilty " )
( train_bengalifemale_02764 " The father shouted back from inside the hollow of the tree, Listen all of you, it is Dharma who stole the money " )
( train_bengalifemale_02765 " Meanwhile, Dharma filled the hollow with rags and hay, poured oil on them and threw a matchstick into it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02766 " All this is the work of Karan's evil mind, said the father and soon collapsed and died " )
( train_bengalifemale_02767 " They said, Our elders have always said that wise men should not be only resourceful but also know the consequences of being resourceful " )
( train_bengalifemale_02768 " You have the story of how a mongoose killed all the offspring of the crane before his own eyes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02769 " When Dharma asked them to tell the story, the king's men began relating the story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02770 " When the mother crane saw the cobra killing her offspring, she began crying " )
( train_bengalifemale_02771 " The crane told the crab, Every day, the cobra living in this tree is killing my children " )
( train_bengalifemale_02772 " Please show me some way to get rid of this cobra " )
( train_bengalifemale_02773 " I shall give her advice that is misleading and suicidal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02774 " That will see the end of all these cranes " )
( train_bengalifemale_02775 " Elders have always said that if you want to wipe out your enemy your words should be soft like butter and your heart like a stone " )
( train_bengalifemale_02776 " Then the crab told the crane, Uncle, strew pieces of meat from the mongoose's burrow to the hollow of the cobra " )
( train_bengalifemale_02777 " The mongoose will follow the trail of meat to the cobra burrow and will kill it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02778 " The crane did as the crab advised her " )
( train_bengalifemale_02779 " The mongoose came following the meat trail and killed not only the cobra but also all the cranes on the tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_02780 " This is why, the king's men said, if you have a strategy, you must also know what strategy would lead to " )
( train_bengalifemale_02781 " Ram told Shaam, That's why like Karan you haven't foreseen what will happen if you went ahead with your plans " )
( train_bengalifemale_02782 " If a rat had a thousand pound scale for its lunch, is it any wonder that a kite carried away a child " )
( train_bengalifemale_02783 " Ram told him the following story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02784 " Raman was the son of a rich merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_02785 " But he had lost all his wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02786 " People who respected him once would now look down upon him and shun him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02787 " Deciding to go abroad to seek his fortune, he mortgaged with a local merchant the thousand pound balance his ancestors had left behind " )
( train_bengalifemale_02788 " He went abroad with the money the merchant gave him and after several years came home and asked the merchant to return him the balance " )
( train_bengalifemale_02789 " The merchant said, where is the balance. The rats have gnawed at it for food " )
( train_bengalifemale_02790 " Raman replied without emotion, I cannot blame you for what the rats have done " )
( train_bengalifemale_02791 " The world is like that. Nothing really is permanent " )
( train_bengalifemale_02792 " Anyway, I am going to the river to take the purification bath " )
( train_bengalifemale_02793 " Please send with me your son Deva to look after my needs " )
( train_bengalifemale_02794 " Afraid that Raman would accuse him of theft, the merchant called his son and told him, Son, your uncle is going to the river for a bath " )
( train_bengalifemale_02795 " You accompany him taking with you all the things he needs to take his bath " )
( train_bengalifemale_02796 " Men offer help not only out of kindness but also out of fear, greed etc " )
( train_bengalifemale_02797 " If one offers help for reasons other than this, you have to be wary of such a person " )
( train_bengalifemale_02798 " The merchant's son followed Raman to the river " )
( train_bengalifemale_02799 " After taking bath, he led the boy into a nearby cave and, pushing the boy inside, closed it with a huge boulder " )
( train_bengalifemale_02800 " When Raman returned from the river, the merchant asked him, honoured guest, didn't you bring back my son " )
( train_bengalifemale_02801 " Raman told him, A kite has carried away your boy " )
( train_bengalifemale_02802 " Otherwise, I will go to the king and complain " )
( train_bengalifemale_02803 " Yes, just as a kite cannot carry away a boy, rats also cannot eat away heavy iron balance " )
( train_bengalifemale_02804 " Both of them took the dispute to the king's court " )
( train_bengalifemale_02805 " The judges ordered him to return the boy to the merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_02806 " Ram then told Shaam, You have done this foul deed because you were jealous of the king's friendship with Bullock " )
( train_bengalifemale_02807 " It is not without reason that our elders have said, " )
( train_bengalifemale_02808 " Fools hate the learned. The poor people blame the rich " )
( train_bengalifemale_02809 " The miser riles the giver. The wicked abhor the virtuous " )
( train_bengalifemale_02810 " You have tried to help us. But you have hurt us " )
( train_bengalifemale_02811 " The monkey served the king in whatever way he could " )
( train_bengalifemale_02812 " He had a free run of the royal household because he was the king’s pet " )
( train_bengalifemale_02813 " One hot day the monkey sat fanning by the side of the king who was sleeping " )
( train_bengalifemale_02814 " He noticed a fly on the chest of the king and tried to swish it away " )
( train_bengalifemale_02815 " The monkey could take it no longer and decided to teach the fly a lesson " )
( train_bengalifemale_02816 " He looked for a dagger to kill it and when he found it brought it down with all force on the fly " )
( train_bengalifemale_02817 " The fly flew away but the king died as result of the dagger blow delivered by the monkey " )
( train_bengalifemale_02818 " He saw four merchants from another city selling a variety of goods in his city " )
( train_bengalifemale_02819 " He thought he should somehow deprive the four merchants of their money and through sweet words become their good friend " )
( train_bengalifemale_02820 " He was useful to them in whatever way he could " )
( train_bengalifemale_02821 " True, it comes naturally for women of vice to act coy and for charlatans to pretend to be learned " )
( train_bengalifemale_02822 " The thief was keeping an eye on what they were doing even when he was pretended to serve them faithfully " )
( train_bengalifemale_02823 " The thief was disappointed that they did not give him even a small part of their wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02824 " He immediately decided to follow them and kill them in the middle of their journey back home and take all that wealth from them " )
( train_bengalifemale_02825 " He told the traders with tears in his eyes, Friends, you seem to be ready to leave me behind " )
( train_bengalifemale_02826 " My heart is broken because it is difficult for me to snap the bonds of friendship with you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02827 " If you will be so kind as to take me with you, I will be very grateful to you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02828 " Moved by his request, the traders started their homeward journey accompanied by the Brahmin thief " )
( train_bengalifemale_02829 " They passed through several villages, towns and cities before they reached a village inhabited by thugs " )
( train_bengalifemale_02830 " Suddenly, they heard a group of crows loudly shouting, You thugs, very rich people are coming " )
( train_bengalifemale_02831 " Come, kill them and become rich " )
( train_bengalifemale_02832 " The thugs at once attacked the traders with sticks began examining their bags " )
( train_bengalifemale_02833 " But they found nothing " )
( train_bengalifemale_02834 " They were surprised because this was the first time the words of crows turned out to be false " )
( train_bengalifemale_02835 " They told the traders, Traders, the crows always tell the truth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02836 " The thief pondered, These thugs will certainly pierce the body of traders to grab the jewels " )
( train_bengalifemale_02837 " It is better I offer myself to these thugs and save the lives of the Merchants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02838 " There is no point in fearing death when it will come today or after hundred years. One cannot escape it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02839 " With these thoughts on his mind, the thief asked the thugs to first kill him and see if there was anything valuable on his body " )
( train_bengalifemale_02840 " The thugs accepted the offer and found nothing on him after they pierced his body " )
( train_bengalifemale_02841 " Gaining Friends. This is the second strategy known as Gaining Friends beginning with this stanza " )
( train_bengalifemale_02842 " Even without the wherewithal, Learned men and intellectuals, Achieve what they want like the crow, the rat, the deer and the turtle " )
( train_bengalifemale_02843 " In the hollow of the great tree lived poisonous reptiles like snakes and scorpions " )
( train_bengalifemale_02844 " Travellers found the tree a great shelter in their journeys " )
( train_bengalifemale_02845 " A crow made this tree his home " )
( train_bengalifemale_02846 " As he was flying one day towards the city for collecting food, he sighted a hunter carrying a net and approaching the tree like a messenger of death " )
( train_bengalifemale_02847 " The crow is pretty sure that the hunter will come to trap the birds on the tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_02848 " He told all the birds, his Friends that the wicked hunter has seeds in his bag that he will scatter to lure you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02849 " The hunter came, sowed the seeds and spread the net " )
( train_bengalifemale_02850 " He left the spot and sat elsewhere not to arouse the suspicion of the birds " )
( train_bengalifemale_02851 " They came to eat the seeds ignoring the warnings of crow and soon the hunter spread his net and trapped all of them " )
( train_bengalifemale_02852 " That is why elders have said that fools can never foresee peril " )
( train_bengalifemale_02853 " People often lose sense when danger lurks in the corner " )
( train_bengalifemale_02854 " Dove King and his retinue, however, kept their cool in the face of danger " )
( train_bengalifemale_02855 " He appealed to his friends not to panic " )
( train_bengalifemale_02856 " Elders have said that they tide over danger, which are not scared by crisis " )
( train_bengalifemale_02857 " We can then plan a strategy to get out of this net " )
( train_bengalifemale_02858 " If we do not fly now, we are all doomed, said Dove King " )
( train_bengalifemale_02859 " The crow, also followed by the flying doves to see what they would do " )
( train_bengalifemale_02860 " When he lost sight of the birds, the hunter gave up and went home ruing that he had lost his net also " )
( train_bengalifemale_02861 " When he was sure that the hunter had failed to chase them, the king of doves told his friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_02862 " The hunter had disappeared " )
( train_bengalifemale_02863 " Let us all now fly towards the city where I have a friend, who is a rat " )
( train_bengalifemale_02864 " The birds, heeding the advice of the king, flew to the fort of rat in the city " )
( train_bengalifemale_02865 " Standing outside the fort, Dove King shouted, friend, come quickly " )
( train_bengalifemale_02866 " What is the kind of trouble that is bothering you. Let me know " )
( train_bengalifemale_02867 " I am your friend king of doves. Come out soon " )
( train_bengalifemale_02868 " The king of doves said, Whatever man does for whatever reasons, in whatever manner and wherever in his last birth " )
( train_bengalifemale_02869 " He reaps the consequences for the same reasons, and in the same manner and in the same place " )
( train_bengalifemale_02870 " Come at once and free us from this trap, urged Dove King " )
( train_bengalifemale_02871 " The rat said, It is rightly said that a bird can recognise food from fifty miles but cannot see the danger lurking next to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02872 " After delivering this sermon, the rat set out to free Dove King first " )
( train_bengalifemale_02873 " But the king of doves pleaded with him to first liberate his friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_02874 " The rat was angry and reminded Dove King that it was fair that the king became free first and then the servants " )
( train_bengalifemale_02875 " No, it is not like that, countered Dove King " )
( train_bengalifemale_02876 " They are all dedicated to my service and have left their families behind to come with me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02877 " I have to repay that debt, he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02878 " Pleased with his friend’s love for his servants, the rat said, Friend, I know the duties of a king " )
( train_bengalifemale_02879 " I was only testing you. I will free everyone now " )
( train_bengalifemale_02880 " This will win more doves for your retinue " )

( train_bengalifemale_02887 " The dove king must be calling me for the same purpose " )
( train_bengalifemale_02888 " Not sure who was calling him, the rat shouted from inside his fort, Who are you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02889 " The crow said who he was " )
( train_bengalifemale_02890 " The rat further retreated into his fort and said, Go away at once, I do not know who you are " )
( train_bengalifemale_02891 " I have come on an important business. Why do not you meet me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02892 " The rat asked What do I gain by meeting you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02893 " Sir, I have seen you liberating Dove King and his retinue " )
( train_bengalifemale_02894 " I thought friendship with you would be useful in such a crisis " )
( train_bengalifemale_02895 " How can there be amity between the two " )
( train_bengalifemale_02896 " Where there is enemity, there cannot be friendship " )
( train_bengalifemale_02897 " Didn’t you hear the elders say, Friendship or marriage is always between equals in nature " )
( train_bengalifemale_02898 " There cannot be any sort of bond between the weak and the strong " )
( train_bengalifemale_02899 " The crow replied, rat, I am waiting here at your doorstep " )
( train_bengalifemale_02900 " If you reject my hand, I will starve here to death " )
( train_bengalifemale_02901 " But friendship with you is not possible " )
( train_bengalifemale_02902 " We haven’t even seen each other " )
( train_bengalifemale_02903 " The first is natural and the second is artificial " )
( train_bengalifemale_02904 " The second kind disappears when what caused it disappears " )
( train_bengalifemale_02905 " But natural enmity ends only with the death of one of the two enemies " )
( train_bengalifemale_02906 " Yes, artificial enemity is always based on some reason " )
( train_bengalifemale_02907 " Natural enemity is like the one between a snake and a mongoose, water and fire, dogs and cats, the rich and the poor, the learned and the illiterate, between women of virtue and vice " )
( train_bengalifemale_02908 " The crow then pleaded, Sir, what you say is unreasonable " )
( train_bengalifemale_02909 " There is always a reason behind friendship and enemity " )
( train_bengalifemale_02910 " That is why a wise man should always seek friendship and not enemity " )
( train_bengalifemale_02911 " True, it is foolish to think that you will not come to harm because you are a man of character " )
( train_bengalifemale_02912 " With good men it is like pot of gold, difficult to break but easy to mend " )

( train_bengalifemale_02916 " Him who trusts others easily, even the weakest can kill " )
( train_bengalifemale_02917 " Rat, he thought, was a very knowledgeable being and that was a strong reason for him to seek his friendship " )
( train_bengalifemale_02918 " Turning to the rat, he said, Seven words are enough to bring two good people together " )
( train_bengalifemale_02919 " We have already talked a lot, which makes us good friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_02920 " That’s why please believe what I say " )
( train_bengalifemale_02921 " If it is not possible, I will stay out and you can talk to me from within your stronghold " )
( train_bengalifemale_02922 " Impressed by his sincerity, the rat said, Okay, you should not step inside my fort " )
( train_bengalifemale_02923 " When crow agreed to the condition, the two became friends and enjoyed their daily meetings and long talks " )
( train_bengalifemale_02924 " They helped each other, the crow bringing pieces of meat and relics of offerings to God at temples for the rat " )
( train_bengalifemale_02925 " Thus they became great and inseparable friends " )
( train_bengalifemale_02926 " One day, the crow came calling on the mouse with eyes full of tears " )
( train_bengalifemale_02927 " Worried, the mouse asked, What’s the matter Why are you so sad " )
( train_bengalifemale_02928 " I am thoroughly fed up with this country " )
( train_bengalifemale_02929 " But what is the reason for this sudden change of mind, asked the mouse " )
( train_bengalifemale_02930 " There is a famine here. People are dying like locusts " )
( train_bengalifemale_02931 " No one is offering cooked rice for the peace of the dead " )
( train_bengalifemale_02932 " I want to leave this country before it comes, said the crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02933 " What are your travel plans then, asked the mouse " )
( train_bengalifemale_02934 " I am a bird and can fly. You cannot do that, said the crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02935 " That’s an idea. I will be doubly happy there because I have the company of the turtle and also yours " )
( train_bengalifemale_02936 " It is better I hide from him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02937 " The turtle immediately ducked under water " )
( train_bengalifemale_02938 " But the crow saw the turtle going down and understood that his friend did not recognise him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02939 " The crow then left the mouse at the bottom of a tree and flying to the top of it loudly addressed the turtle, Turtle, I am your friend crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02940 " Come out and welcome me who has come to see an old friend after a long time " )
( train_bengalifemale_02941 " Recognising his friend’s voice, the turtle came out of the water and with tears of joy in his eyes, said, crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02942 " We are meeting after a long time and that’s why I could not immediately recognise you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02943 " You know the saying that you should not make friends with him whose power and pedigree are not known to you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02944 " The crow then came down from the tree and true of them embraced each other in joy " )
( train_bengalifemale_02945 " They began telling each other about what happened in the long interval of their separation " )
( train_bengalifemale_02946 " The turtle asked the crow, who is this little friend of yours " )
( train_bengalifemale_02947 " He is my friend rat. I can’t live without him " )
( train_bengalifemale_02948 " Just as you cannot count the stars in the sky and the sands on the seashore, I cannot recount his great qualities " )
( train_bengalifemale_02949 " He is fed up with this world. That is why he has followed me on my visit to you, said the crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_02950 " The crow replied, I have asked him to tell me the reasons " )
( train_bengalifemale_02951 " Rat began telling his story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02952 " In the south of this city, said the rat, lived a hermit in a Shiva temple on the outskirts of the city " )
( train_bengalifemale_02953 " One day, some of my relatives complained to me, that the hermit is storing the food in his bowl and hanging it high to a peg " )
( train_bengalifemale_02954 " Accompanied by my relatives, I went to the hermit’s place and springing at the bowl brought the stored food down " )
( train_bengalifemale_02955 " All of us then had a good meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02956 " We repeated this act every day till the hermit found what we were doing " )
( train_bengalifemale_02957 " He brought a split bamboo and began striking the food bowl with it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02958 " That noise used to frighten us and we would spend the whole night waiting for a respite from this noise " )
( train_bengalifemale_02959 " But the hermit never stopped striking the bamboo " )
( train_bengalifemale_02960 " Meanwhile, a visitor named Veer, came calling on the hermit " )
( train_bengalifemale_02961 " Angry with hermit’s absent mindedness, the visitor told him, hermit, you are not a great friend of mine because you are not attentive to what I am telling you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02962 " The elders have always said that you must not accept the hospitality of such a host who does not welcome you gladly " )
( train_bengalifemale_02963 " You did not offer me a proper seat and did not make inquiries about my well being " )
( train_bengalifemale_02964 " Status has gone to your head " )
( train_bengalifemale_02965 " You do not know that this conduct will take you to hell " )
( train_bengalifemale_02966 " I am really sorry for what has happened to you. You have become vain and proud. I am leaving this temple at once, Veer said " )
( train_bengalifemale_02967 " Frightened at his visitor’s words, the hermit pleaded with him, O worshipful guest, please do not be harsh on me " )
( train_bengalifemale_02968 " I do not have any friends other than you. Here is the reason why I was not attentive to your discourse on religion " )
( train_bengalifemale_02969 " There is this mouse, which every day steals my food however high I keep it " )
( train_bengalifemale_02970 " As a result, I am not able to feed the poor people who do the job of keeping the temple clean " )
( train_bengalifemale_02971 " This is why I was not able to pay attention to the great and learned tales you have been relating " )
( train_bengalifemale_02972 " Realising what really was the problem, the visitor asked the hermit, Do you know where the mouse lives " )
( train_bengalifemale_02973 " It is this plenty that gives him the energy to jump so high and eat all your food " )
( train_bengalifemale_02974 " When a man earns a lot of wealth, that pile of money increases his strength and confidence " )
( train_bengalifemale_02975 " There is a reason for Shanthi trying to exchange husked sesame seeds in return for degraded sesame seeds " )
( train_bengalifemale_02976 " The story of Shanthi and sesame seeds " )
( train_bengalifemale_02977 " Veer began telling the story " )
( train_bengalifemale_02978 " I sought the hospitality of a Brahmin one day for sacred ceremonies connected with the monsoon season " )
( train_bengalifemale_02979 " I am going to the next village to receive the offerings " )
( train_bengalifemale_02980 " The wife flew into a rage and told him, How can I offer anything to anyone in our poverty stricken house " )
( train_bengalifemale_02981 " I have wasted my entire life as your wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_02982 " I haven’t tasted a good meal so far even on a single day " )
( train_bengalifemale_02983 " Nor do I have any jewellery " )
( train_bengalifemale_02984 " Though taken aback, the Brahmin quickly recovered and said, Such words are not becoming of you " )
( train_bengalifemale_02985 " The learned say that if you share even half of your meal with a mendicant, you will get whatever you wish in life " )
( train_bengalifemale_02986 " What good the rich reap by liberally giving away, the poor get by parting with even a cent they have " )
( train_bengalifemale_02987 " The giver deserves to be served even if he is poor " )
( train_bengalifemale_02988 " But a rich miser is shunned " )
( train_bengalifemale_02989 " It is like the well and the sea " )
( train_bengalifemale_02990 " We must always give to him who deserves " )
( train_bengalifemale_02991 " Greed can only destroy a person " )
( train_bengalifemale_02992 " How is it asked the wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_02993 " The husband then told Shanthi the story of the hunter and the greedy jackal " )
( train_bengalifemale_02994 " A hunter went into the forest in search of a kill " )
( train_bengalifemale_02995 " The boar too died later from the wounds inflicted by the hunter " )
( train_bengalifemale_02996 " Meanwhile, a hungry jackal, not knowing that he was doomed to die, came on the scene where the bodies of the hunter and the boar lay " )
( train_bengalifemale_02997 " He was thrilled by the sight of so much food and thought, God has favoured me today " )
( train_bengalifemale_02998 " But a man must enjoy his wealth in small doses " )
( train_bengalifemale_02999 " The jackal went close to the body of the hunter and began nibbling near the gut of the bow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03000 " The gut suddenly snapped with great force killing the jackal in the end " )
( train_bengalifemale_03001 " I will make a cake from it and serve it to a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03002 " Happy at his wife’s words, the Brahmin left for the next village " )
( train_bengalifemale_03003 " The wife soaked the seeds in warm water, removed their husk and left them on a cloth to dry in the sun " )
( train_bengalifemale_03004 " As the Brahmin’s wife was busy with other chores, a dog came and peed on the seeds left on the cloth to dry " )
( train_bengalifemale_03005 " She thought that nobody could undo God’s will " )
( train_bengalifemale_03006 " She thought, These seeds cannot now be given away to anyone " )
( train_bengalifemale_03007 " I will see if I can exchange them for unhusked seeds " )
( train_bengalifemale_03008 " Anybody will agree to this swap " )
( train_bengalifemale_03009 " Veer continued his story, The Brahmin’s wife came to the same house which I was visiting to accept offerings " )
( train_bengalifemale_03010 " Then the woman in the house came out and was ready to accept the husked seeds from the Brahmin’s wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_03011 " But her son intervened and told her, Mother, these seeds are not good " )
( train_bengalifemale_03012 " Why should anyone give away good husked seeds for the raw seeds There must be some reason for it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03013 " The housewife at once gave up the idea of taking husked seeds from the Brahmin’s wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_03014 " After Veer completed the story, he asked the hermit, Do you know the route the rat takes to come here. I have no idea, said hermit " )
( train_bengalifemale_03015 " Have you any tool to dig, asked the visitor " )
( train_bengalifemale_03016 " Yes, I have a dibble with me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03017 " Rat resumed his account and said, Listening to the conversation between the hermit and Veer, I thought that my end had come " )
( train_bengalifemale_03018 " Just as he had found my food store, he is capable of tracking my fort " )
( train_bengalifemale_03019 " I decided immediately to take a new route and was on my way with the other mice when a fat cat sighted us " )
( train_bengalifemale_03020 " He immediately pounced on us and killed a number of my retinue " )
( train_bengalifemale_03021 " There, Veer and the hermit dug and found the food store " )
( train_bengalifemale_03022 " The visitor told the hermit, Here is the secret of the mouse’s energy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03023 " Now, you can sleep in peace " )
( train_bengalifemale_03024 " It was now like a desert " )
( train_bengalifemale_03025 " I did not know where to go and what to do to get back my peace of mind " )
( train_bengalifemale_03026 " Somehow, I spent the day in sorrow and when it was dawn went to the temple followed by what remained of my retinue " )
( train_bengalifemale_03027 " Alerted by the noise we made, the hermit again began striking the food bowl with a bamboo " )
( train_bengalifemale_03028 " Veer, the visitor, asked him why he was doing so " )
( train_bengalifemale_03029 " The visitor laughed and told the hermit, Friend, do not be afraid now " )
( train_bengalifemale_03030 " It cannot do any mischief now " )
( train_bengalifemale_03031 " When I heard this, I was angry and tried again to jump at the food bowl and crashed to the ground before I could reach the bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_03032 " I was dejected by this failure " )
( train_bengalifemale_03033 " But my sadness increased when I heard my retinue telling each other that I was no more capable of earning food for them and they should immediately give up serving me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03034 " When I made another attempt, the visitor saw me and banged the bamboo on my head " )
( train_bengalifemale_03035 " I somehow managed to escape " )
( train_bengalifemale_03036 " Elders have always said that man gets what he is destined to " )
( train_bengalifemale_03037 " Even God cannot alter destiny " )
( train_bengalifemale_03038 " So, I stopped brooding over what has happened because what is ours can never become others " )
( train_bengalifemale_03039 " Explain that to us, asked crow and turtle " )
( train_bengalifemale_03040 " The Story of a merchant’s son " )
( train_bengalifemale_03041 " Sagar was a merchant living in one of the country’s big cities " )
( train_bengalifemale_03042 " Even God cannot prevent it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03043 " The father flew into a rage and said, You are a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_03044 " The father flew into a rage and said, You are a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_03045 " The father flew into a rage and said, You are a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_03046 " The king's men and others mistaking it for a real duel were ready to kill old wise crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03047 " When crow king told them Do not interfere Go away " )
( train_bengalifemale_03048 " I will have the pleasure of punishing this unfaithful fellow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03049 " Crow king then pretended to attack the old wise crow with his beak and doused him in blood he brought with him and left for the hills " )
( train_bengalifemale_03050 " Then wife of Owl King who was spying on the crow camp carried this assault on minister wise old crow and the king's departure for the hills to the owl king " )
( train_bengalifemale_03051 " Soon after sunset the owl king accompanied by his ministers and followers set out to kill all the crows " )
( train_bengalifemale_03052 " They reached the tree home of the crows and surrounded it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03053 " Not finding a single crow there and happy for that reason owl king told his men to look for the crows so that they could chase them and kill them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03054 " Meanwhile the old wise crow who suffered mock injuries began weakly moaning to attract the attention of the owls " )
( train_bengalifemale_03055 " When the owls saw this and rushed to kill him he pleaded Sir my name is old wise crow and I am minister of Crow king the king of crows " )
( train_bengalifemale_03056 " Before you kill me I have something to convey to your king " )
( train_bengalifemale_03057 " Owl king came to see the minister at once and asked him the reason for his plight " )
( train_bengalifemale_03058 " Old wise crow told him Our king wanted to avenge the massacre of his subjects by your men " )
( train_bengalifemale_03059 " When I knew he was bent upon waging a war with you I advised him not to be rash and not go to war with you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03060 " I asked him to sign peace with you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03061 " My king thought that I was on your side and in great anger inflicted these injuries on me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03062 " As soon as I recover I will show you where he and his men are hiding " )
( train_bengalifemale_03063 " You can destroy them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03064 " The king of owls called a meeting of his elders and his five ministers for consultations " )
( train_bengalifemale_03065 " He asked his first minister Friend our enemy's minister is in our custody " )
( train_bengalifemale_03066 " What shall we do with him The minister said What is there to discuss Kill him instantly without hesitation " )
( train_bengalifemale_03067 " It is always better to destroy the enemy before he acquires strength " )

( train_bengalifemale_03069 " If you lose it now you will never get it back " )
( train_bengalifemale_03070 " Do not be carried away by Crow minister's show or affection " )
( train_bengalifemale_03071 " Because once lost love never returns " )
( train_bengalifemale_03072 " To drive home the point owl minister related to the king of owls the story of a cobra and a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03073 " Hari was a Brahmin living in a hamlet " )
( train_bengalifemale_03074 " He was a farmer but the piece of land he cultivated gave him very little to survive " )
( train_bengalifemale_03075 " One day unable to stand the heat of the summer sun he went to a big tree in his land to rest for a while " )
( train_bengalifemale_03076 " Before he could spread himself on the ground he saw in the nearby anthill a huge cobra swaying with his hood open " )
( train_bengalifemale_03077 " He thought This cobra must really be the Goddess of this land " )
( train_bengalifemale_03078 " I have never worshipped her which is why I am not able to get anything from the land " )
( train_bengalifemale_03079 " From today I will worship her " )
( train_bengalifemale_03080 " At once he went back to his village and returned with a glass full of milk " )
( train_bengalifemale_03081 " He poured it in a bowl and turning to the anthill said ruler of the land I did not know you were living in this anthill " )
( train_bengalifemale_03082 " That is why I have not paid my tribute to you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03083 " Please excuse me and accept this humble offering " )
( train_bengalifemale_03084 " He then placed the bowl of milk at the anthill and left the place " )
( train_bengalifemale_03085 " Next day when the Brahmin came to his land before the Sun was up he saw a gold coin in the bowl he had left at the anthill " )
( train_bengalifemale_03086 " Henceforth he came alone every dawn collected the coin offered the milk in the bowl and left " )
( train_bengalifemale_03087 " One day the Brahmin leaving for another village on business asked his son to go to the ant hill and offer milk " )
( train_bengalifemale_03088 " When the son went the next day he found a gold coin in the bowl " )
( train_bengalifemale_03089 " He collected the coin and thought This anthill must be full of gold " )
( train_bengalifemale_03090 " If I kill the cobra I can collect all the gold in one go instead of coming here every day " )
( train_bengalifemale_03091 " He then struck the cobra with a big stick " )
( train_bengalifemale_03092 " But the cobra deftly dodged the blow but stung the son to death with his poisonous fangs " )
( train_bengalifemale_03093 " Returning to his village the next day Hari heard the story of his son's death and at once realised that greed was behind it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03094 " The Brahmin went to the anthill the day after his son's cremation and offered milk to the cobra " )
( train_bengalifemale_03095 " Without coming out of his hole the cobra told Hari You have come here for gold forgetting that you had lost a son and that you were in mourning " )
( train_bengalifemale_03096 " The reason is greed pure greed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03097 " From today there is no meaning in our relationship " )
( train_bengalifemale_03098 " Blinded by his youth your son has struck me and I bit him back " )
( train_bengalifemale_03099 " How can I forget that blow How can you suffer the grief of your son's death " )
( train_bengalifemale_03100 " Finally I am giving you this diamond do not come back again " )
( train_bengalifemale_03101 " Ending the story of the Brahmin and the cobra the minister told owl king The lesson is that love once betrayed cannot be regained " )
( train_bengalifemale_03102 " If you kill this crow minister you will have no problems left " )
( train_bengalifemale_03103 " After listening to his minister patiently the king of owls turned to his second minister and asked him for his opinion " )
( train_bengalifemale_03104 " The second minister said my lord I do not agree with the advice what first minister gave you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03105 " It is very unkind We should never kill a person seeking asylum " )
( train_bengalifemale_03106 " There is a fine story about how knowing that a hunter who sought shelter had in fact come to kill him a dove offered himself as food to the hunter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03107 " On the king asking him to relate that story the minister told him the following tale " )
( train_bengalifemale_03108 " Once upon a time there lived a merciless hunter in the heart of a forest terrorizing birds and animals " )
( train_bengalifemale_03109 " Because of his cruel nature he had no friends or relatives " )
( train_bengalifemale_03110 " The elders have said It is unwise to be close to Men who are wicked and cruel " )
( train_bengalifemale_03111 " Avoid such heinous persons as You avoid poisonous snakes " )
( train_bengalifemale_03112 " The hunter went out into the forest every morning with a stick and net " )
( train_bengalifemale_03113 " One day he threw his net and trapped a female dove in it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03114 " Soon thick and black clouds appeared in the sky and it began raining cats and dogs " )
( train_bengalifemale_03115 " Scared and shivering the hunter looked for shelter and found it under a huge banyan tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_03116 " The rain and wind stopped suddenly " )
( train_bengalifemale_03117 " The skies became clear with stars shining " )
( train_bengalifemale_03118 " The hunter said loudly If there is anyone on the tree I seek shelter and food from him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03119 " I am hungry and may faint any moment Please save me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03120 " At the same time a dove that had his nest on the same tree was worried that his wife who had gone out had not come back " )
( train_bengalifemale_03121 " He prayed to Gods that his wife should not come to any harm in this wind and rain " )
( train_bengalifemale_03122 " He began telling himself Blessed and happy is the man With a caring and loving wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_03123 " A home is not a home without a wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_03124 " A wifeless home is like a jungle " )
( train_bengalifemale_03125 " The wife trapped in the hunter's net heard her husband's sorrowful words and happy that her husband loved her so much thought Do not call her a woman Whose husband is unhappy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03126 " Where happy husbands live Heavens shower blessings " )
( train_bengalifemale_03127 " Later addressing her husband the female dove said Listen to me my dear " )
( train_bengalifemale_03128 " Even at the cost of your life you must come to the rescue of someone seeking shelter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03129 " This hunter is suffering from cold and hunger and has sought shelter under our tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_03130 " You must serve him with devotion " )
( train_bengalifemale_03131 " Do not hate him because he has trapped your beloved wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_03132 " In reality the strings of destiny have bound me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03133 " Give up all thoughts of revenge and serve the hunter with care " )
( train_bengalifemale_03134 " In accordance with his wife's desire the dove suppressed grief and told the hunter Sir you are welcome to our modest home " )
( train_bengalifemale_03135 " Please let me know what I can do for you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03136 " Treat this as own home and feel free to command me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03137 " The hunter told the dove that he was suffering from cold and needed relief " )
( train_bengalifemale_03138 " The dove flew out brought fire from somewhere and a lit a small fire with dry twigs and asked the hunter to warm himself " )
( train_bengalifemale_03139 " The dove told the hunter Because of my past deeds I am born poor and unfortunate and do not have enough to feed myself " )
( train_bengalifemale_03140 " What is the point in a host living if he cannot entertain a guest It is better he renounce this world " )
( train_bengalifemale_03141 " Yet he thought that it was better to die than say no to a host " )
( train_bengalifemale_03142 " Determined to die the dove told the hunter to wait for a while and that soon he will have food " )
( train_bengalifemale_03143 " Then circling over the fire the dove jumped into the fire he lit for the benefit of the hunter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03144 " Moved by this sacrifice the hunter told himself I am responsible for this tragedy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03145 " I will no doubt go to hell " )
( train_bengalifemale_03146 " This dove, is a great soul, he has shown me the right path " )
( train_bengalifemale_03147 " Hereafter, I will give up, all wants and desires and slowly destroy this body " )
( train_bengalifemale_03148 " Nothing, neither cold nor sun nor wind, matters to me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03149 " I will fast, and see my slow end " )
( train_bengalifemale_03150 " The hunter then threw his net, and stick, an, released the female dove, from the net " )
( train_bengalifemale_03151 " She thought, that life without her husband was worse than death, and at once, jumped into the same fire that consumed her, husband " )

( train_bengalifemale_03153 " The dove couple lived happily, ever after " )
( train_bengalifemale_03154 " After Second Minister ended telling the king, the hunter’s story, owl king asked, a third minister, for his advice on dealing, with the old wise crow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03155 " The minister told the king, My lord, old wise crow does not deserve to be killed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03156 " He will be of use to us in revealing the secrets of the enemy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03157 " On the king commanding him, the third minister began telling him the story of the old man, his young wife, and the thief " )
( train_bengalifemale_03158 " Once upon a time there was a king Deva " )
( train_bengalifemale_03159 " He had a son, who was very weak, and growing weaker, by the day " )

( train_bengalifemale_03168 " Take this foul mouthed woman, away and marry her off to some stranger " )
( train_bengalifemale_03169 " Let her weep the consequences of her actions " )
( train_bengalifemale_03170 " The daughter considered the king’s son as God’s gift and after persuading him, left for another country " )
( train_bengalifemale_03171 " The princess and the son, of Deva reached a city, where they camped close to a lake " )

( train_bengalifemale_03174 " The serpent in his stomach came out to breathe fresh air " )
( train_bengalifemale_03175 " The anthill inmate said, You wicked creature, why do you torment such a handsome prince " )
( train_bengalifemale_03176 " The other serpent retorted, Why are you polluting, the two golden urns in your hole " )
( train_bengalifemale_03177 " Thus, in their row, they revealed, the secrets, of each other " )
( train_bengalifemale_03178 " The serpent in the anthill told the other serpent, Do not be arrogant " )
( train_bengalifemale_03179 " Is that so. You will also perish if someone pours hot oil or hot water, in your ant hill " )
( train_bengalifemale_03180 " Do not be too proud, said the serpent, in the prince’s stomach " )
( train_bengalifemale_03181 " The princess, who heard, all that passed between the two serpents " )
( train_bengalifemale_03182 " She poured hot oil into the ant hill, and, took the, two golden urns " )
( train_bengalifemale_03183 " Gave the mustard mixture to her husband, and killed the serpent, inside his stomach " )
( train_bengalifemale_03184 " Both Deva’s son, and his daughter in law, returned to his kingdom, and lived happily, ever after " )
( train_bengalifemale_03185 " After listening to this story, the owl king accepted his advice that the, old wise crow’s life should be spared " )
( train_bengalifemale_03186 " The learned have said, that where wicked men are honoured, and wise men are insulted, there will be fear, famine, and death " )
( train_bengalifemale_03187 " Disregarding the warning of first minister, the king’s men set out to take the old wise crow to their fortress " )
( train_bengalifemale_03188 " On the way, wise crow said, My lord, in my condition, I cannot be of any help to you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03189 " Please permit me to do that " )
( train_bengalifemale_03190 " Sensing his internal thoughts the first minister asked him, why he would want to end up in a fire " )
( train_bengalifemale_03191 " The minister said, You are a cheat good at spinning words " )
( train_bengalifemale_03192 " You were really born as a crow and even if you are born as an owl in your next birth you will still be a crow in nature " )
( train_bengalifemale_03193 " Haven’t you heard the story of the mouse " )
( train_bengalifemale_03194 " The ministers and other king’s men pressed him to tell them that story " )
( train_bengalifemale_03195 " Hit by the stone the kite released, its prey and the mouse at once ran to the sage asking him for protection " )
( train_bengalifemale_03196 " Why do you preach all those irrelevant rules of conduct to me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03197 " The kite delivered a big lecture to the sage, on the right path " )
( train_bengalifemale_03198 " God has marked mice, other rodents, and insects to be, food for us " )
( train_bengalifemale_03199 " Why do you blame me for seeking what God has meant for me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03200 " There is nothing wrong for anyone to eat the food marked for him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03201 " The danger comes when one eats what is not food for him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03202 " What is meat for someone is poison for someone else " )
( train_bengalifemale_03203 " It is not proper, for sages to be violent " )
( train_bengalifemale_03204 " They are not presumed to notice what is happening around them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03205 " They are detach from this world " )
( train_bengalifemale_03206 " Nothing that happens in the material, world should, interest them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03207 " They are above, everything " )
( train_bengalifemale_03208 " But by your deed today you have lost all the gains of your penance " )
( train_bengalifemale_03209 " Learn from this story of three brothers how to attain that state of detachment " )
( train_bengalifemale_03210 " Sage asked the kite to relate the story to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03211 " The kite told him the following story " )
( train_bengalifemale_03212 " Once upon a time three sages, who were also brothers, chose a riverbank to do, penance " )
( train_bengalifemale_03213 " Their names were Ram, Sam and Sunil " )
( train_bengalifemale_03214 " The clothes they washed, every day used to dry in the sky without a clothesline, lest they should drop and become soiled " )
( train_bengalifemale_03215 " One day, a kite was carrying a female frog like I carried a female mouse " )
( train_bengalifemale_03216 " Ram saw this, and shouted at the kite, Leave it, Leave it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03217 " At once his clothes drying in the sky dropped down to the ground " )
( train_bengalifemale_03218 " When Sam saw this, he shouted at the kite, Do not leave it, and soon his clothes also came down hurtling " )
( train_bengalifemale_03219 " Sunil saw that the clothes of his elder brothers fell down " )
( train_bengalifemale_03220 " He thought it would be better not to say anything and remained silent " )
( train_bengalifemale_03221 " That is why it is better not to notice the happenings around and concentrate on self " )
( train_bengalifemale_03222 " The sage replied, foolish kite, your story has happened in the age of truth when even if you spoke to a wicked person you became a sinner " )
( train_bengalifemale_03223 " The clothes came down because of the first two sages addressed the wicked kite " )
( train_bengalifemale_03224 " In this age only those who commit a sin become sinners and not those who speak to sinners " )
( train_bengalifemale_03225 " Now, do not waste my time. Disperse or face my curse " )
( train_bengalifemale_03226 " The kite flew away disappointed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03227 " I will spend the rest of my life with whatever leftovers you choose to feed me with " )
( train_bengalifemale_03228 " So, he turned the mouse into a beautiful girl and took her home " )
( train_bengalifemale_03229 " Where did you bring this girl from " )
( train_bengalifemale_03230 " She needed protection from wicked birds " )
( train_bengalifemale_03231 " That’s why I turned her into a girl and brought her home " )
( train_bengalifemale_03232 " You will need to shower all care on her " )
( train_bengalifemale_03233 " I will make her a mouse again, said the sage " )
( train_bengalifemale_03234 " Please do not do that, pleaded his wife, You have saved her life and therefore you have become her father " )
( train_bengalifemale_03235 " I do not have a child " )
( train_bengalifemale_03236 " Since you are her father, she becomes my daughter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03237 " So do his ancestors. It’s all right. Look for a boy, said his wife " )
( train_bengalifemale_03238 " Sage immediately summoned the Sun and told him, This is my daughter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03239 " She said that the Sun was very hot and she would prefer someone else " )
( train_bengalifemale_03240 " Then the God of Mountains told the sage, The most suitable candidate for your daughter is a mouse " )
( train_bengalifemale_03241 " He is more powerful than I am " )
( train_bengalifemale_03242 " The sage then turned her into a mouse and gave her away to a king of mice in marriage " )
( train_bengalifemale_03243 " That’s why, first minister resumed, I want you know that a crow is a crow and cannot become an owl " )
( train_bengalifemale_03244 " Yet, disregarding minister’s warnings, the king’s men took away old wise crow to their fortress not knowing that they were bringing ruin upon themselves and the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_03245 " Old wise crow thought on the other way to his destination, This elder minister alone advised the king to kill me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03246 " When old wise crow’s procession arrived at the entrance of the fortress, the owl king ordered his men to accommodate him in a comfortable place of his choice " )
( train_bengalifemale_03247 " But the old wise crow had other ideas " )
( train_bengalifemale_03248 " If he had to hatch a plan to kill the king, it was not possible within the fort because he and his movements would be constantly under watch " )
( train_bengalifemale_03249 " That would alert his hosts. So, he thought, it was better to be outside the fort " )
( train_bengalifemale_03250 " He told the king, My lord, I am grateful for your generosity " )
( train_bengalifemale_03251 " But I am a politician and belong to the enemy camp " )
( train_bengalifemale_03252 " It does not become of me to live inside the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_03253 " I will stay at the entrance of the fort and every day sanctify my body with the dust of your feet " )
( train_bengalifemale_03254 " Seeing wise crow’s new personality, the first owl minister told the king and the other ministers, I regard all of you as very unwise " )
( train_bengalifemale_03255 " Then the hunter and then the king and his ministers " )
( train_bengalifemale_03256 " How was that asked the ministers and he began telling them the story of sindhu " )
( train_bengalifemale_03257 " Tale of the golden droppings " )
( train_bengalifemale_03258 " On a big tree in the lap of a mountain lived a bird named sindhu " )
( train_bengalifemale_03259 " One day, a hunter came to the tree in search of prey and saw sindhu’s droppings hit the ground and turn into gold " )
( train_bengalifemale_03260 " Now I am eighty years old " )
( train_bengalifemale_03261 " I have never seen in my life this kind of miracle " )
( train_bengalifemale_03262 " He decided to get the bird somehow and set a noose for him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03263 " Not aware of the trap, the bird stayed on the branch merrily singing " )
( train_bengalifemale_03264 " Soon, the noose tightened and the hunter caught the bird and pushed him into his cage " )
( train_bengalifemale_03265 " The hunter took it home and considered, If the king comes to know of this wonder, he will certainly take away the bird from me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03266 " Instead, I will go to the king and present the unique bird to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03267 " The hunter took the bird the following day to the king and presented it to him with great reverence " )
( train_bengalifemale_03268 " The king was extremely happy and told his men to keep the bird in safe custody and feed him with the best bird food " )
( train_bengalifemale_03269 " He said, king, There is no use in trusting the word of this hunter and accepting the bird " )
( train_bengalifemale_03270 " Has anyone seen a bird dropping gold " )
( train_bengalifemale_03271 " Therefore, I request you to release the bird from the cage " )
( train_bengalifemale_03272 " The king ordered the bird to be set free " )
( train_bengalifemale_03273 " sindhu then recited that line about fools, First, I was a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_03274 " The senior owl minister continued, That’s why I tell you that we are all fools in sparing the life of this minister of the crows " )
( train_bengalifemale_03275 " Despite minister’s warnings, the owls continued to look after old wise crow with great devotion " )
( train_bengalifemale_03276 " Giving up all hopes of reforming his king and ministers, the senior owl minister called his close colleagues " )
( train_bengalifemale_03277 " We have given whatever advice a minister has to give " )
( train_bengalifemale_03278 " We shall now leave this dangerous place and pitch our tents elsewhere " )
( train_bengalifemale_03279 " I have been living in this jungle for so long, I have become old " )
( train_bengalifemale_03280 " Yet, in all my life I have never heard a cave speaking like a human being " )
( train_bengalifemale_03281 " We have never heard of it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03282 " There was no animal, big or small, as far as he could see " )
( train_bengalifemale_03283 " If so, it is bound to return to the cave in the evening " )
( train_bengalifemale_03284 " I will hide myself in the cave and when the animal returns, pounce on him and have a good meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03285 " Then as the sun began to set, a jackal, came to the cave that was his home and saw the footprints of the lion entering the cave " )
( train_bengalifemale_03286 " Scared, the jackal wanted to make sure that it was a lion or some big animal that went into the cave " )
( train_bengalifemale_03287 " But how should he know He hit upon a brilliant idea " )
( train_bengalifemale_03288 " There was no reply from the cave " )
( train_bengalifemale_03289 " He again shouted, Hello cave, do you not remember the arrangement we made " )
( train_bengalifemale_03290 " I have to shout when I arrive at the cave and you will ask me to come in " )
( train_bengalifemale_03291 " Without your green signal I do not enter the cave " )
( train_bengalifemale_03292 " Lion heard the jackal speaking and thought, Ah, there seems to be an arrangement between the cave and this animal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03293 " The lion then roared, Hi jackal, come in. You welcome " )
( train_bengalifemale_03294 " The jackal at once knew it was a lion inside the cave and hurriedly fled the place " )
( train_bengalifemale_03295 " He who does not, comes to grief " )
( train_bengalifemale_03296 " Let us leave now before it is too late " )
( train_bengalifemale_03297 " Listening to his advice, his ministers and others followed him to a far off place " )
( train_bengalifemale_03298 " Old wise crow began piling up twigs on the pretext of building a nest " )
( train_bengalifemale_03299 " He heaped them at the entrance of the cave in which the king and other owls lived " )
( train_bengalifemale_03300 " Then he flew off to Crow king and told him that before word could reach the enemy camp of this plan " )
( train_bengalifemale_03301 " He and his followers should accompany him each carrying a piece of burning wood " )
( train_bengalifemale_03302 " When they reached the entrance of the cave, which was now blocked by the pile of twigs old wise crow built, they threw the burning twigs on the pile " )
( train_bengalifemale_03303 " The twigs began to burn fiercely killing all the owls trapped inside " )
( train_bengalifemale_03304 " Luckily, except an old owl, every one of owl king’s ministers was a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_03305 " The tale of frogs that rode a snake " )
( train_bengalifemale_03306 " A black snake lived in a forest on the Varuna hills " )
( train_bengalifemale_03307 " He was becoming old and worried that he would not be able to snare frogs anymore and that would make him weak and bring his end closer " )
( train_bengalifemale_03308 " A frog in the lake came out and asked him, Uncle, why are you not preying for food as you used to do in the past " )
( train_bengalifemale_03309 " How can I have any fervor for food " )
( train_bengalifemale_03310 " Last night when I was on my rounds looking for food I sighted a frog " )
( train_bengalifemale_03311 " When I tried to get at him, he jumped into the middle of a group of priests reciting the Vedas " )
( train_bengalifemale_03312 " Rayar asked about the person Timmarusu was referring to " )
( train_bengalifemale_03313 " Immediately Timmarusu told the King that it was none other than poet Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03314 " Taking the King's permission Timmarusu headed to Raman's residence and explained the whole sequence along with the worries of the King Rayar " )
( train_bengalifemale_03315 " Raman in a cool fashion studied the invitation and the warning letter " )

( train_bengalifemale_03346 " At one stage as these personalities were unable to compete with Raman in wit and ingenuity decided to humiliate Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03347 " They handed over the responsibility of insulting Raman to the main entrance guards " )

( train_bengalifemale_03357 " Long before those guards could understand the meaning of the poem Raman walked stiff into the main court hall " )
( train_bengalifemale_03358 " After sometime while the King Rayar was into one of the pleasure rounds of literary discussions the guards entered the hall and complained that Raman disgraced them with the poem at the main entrance " )
( train_bengalifemale_03359 " After listening to all the details narrated by the guards Rayar ordered Raman to extempore compose a poem taking the same end line with a situation in Mahabharatha " )

( train_bengalifemale_03362 " Losing in the gamble with Gauravas they had to live incognito for some time " )
( train_bengalifemale_03363 " During this period they served a weak ruler " )
( train_bengalifemale_03364 " By all Gods It is the fate of those Pandavas to serve such a weak person in spite of being renowned warriors " )
( train_bengalifemale_03365 " This is similar to a fleet of strong elephants being stuck in the throat of a small mosquito " )
( train_bengalifemale_03366 " Rayar clapped in all praise of Raman for his ingenuity and wit filled narration " )
( train_bengalifemale_03367 " In the full house Rayar hugged Raman and appreciated him agreeing that Raman's words are like double edged swords " )

( train_bengalifemale_03389 " Poor fellows what they can do " )
( train_bengalifemale_03390 " The condition of the test was to take out a word satisfied from her after the performance " )
( train_bengalifemale_03391 " Enough It is alright Raman told all of them She just needs to be satisfied with a Ramayana concert I will do it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03392 " One of you keep her informed about my willingness to satisfy her Raman said and headed towards his accommodation " )

( train_bengalifemale_03400 " You should do whatever I say as a part of the presentation " )
( train_bengalifemale_03401 " After I complete the narration you can reward me if you are satisfied and punish me otherwise " )

( train_bengalifemale_03509 " First he never knew that such books of standards existed secondly Raman brought that along with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03510 " What am I to do if he countered my argument and presented one or the other citations from the book in support of his counter argument " )
( train_bengalifemale_03511 " I will be put to shame and my skills and expertise would never be respected again " )
( train_bengalifemale_03512 " Sam thought for a while and decided to do something " )

( train_bengalifemale_03550 " Finishing his work the barber left the place in silence " )
( train_bengalifemale_03551 " After sometime Rayar opened his eyes " )
( train_bengalifemale_03552 " He did not find the barber waiting by the door " )
( train_bengalifemale_03553 " Angrily he clapped for the attendant and shouted at him for bringing the barber in a moment " )
( train_bengalifemale_03554 " Slowly he got off the armchair and casually put his hand on the chin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03555 " Rayar grew suspicious and walked in front of the mirror and looked at his image in there " )
( train_bengalifemale_03556 " The hair was cleanly cut and beard was neatly shaved " )
( train_bengalifemale_03557 " Meanwhile the attendant brought the barber before him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03558 " Rayar was impressed about the barber's job and appreciated him You Barber I am satisfied for your job " )
( train_bengalifemale_03559 " I wish to bestow a boon go on ask one I will accomplish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03560 " Hesitantly the barber presented his good old desire Since long My Lord I carry a wish to become a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03561 " Kindly bless me with this I do not need anything as my family and me do not have anything short with the Lord's mercy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03562 " Rayar was stunned to know the barber's desire " )
( train_bengalifemale_03563 " However he assured This is not any big boon tomorrow itself your wish will be fulfilled " )
( train_bengalifemale_03564 " He waved the barber to leave and summoned for some Brahmins " )
( train_bengalifemale_03565 " Dear Brahmins I promised the barber to transform him as a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03566 " You should do it with all your knowledge and keep my word " )
( train_bengalifemale_03567 " All of you will be rewarded suitably Rayar ordered " )
( train_bengalifemale_03568 " On hearing the sound of a reward the Brahmins were lured and told the king As you wish My Lord We will transform the barber into a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03569 " The news of barber turning a Brahmin spread in the city and all the Brahmin community " )
( train_bengalifemale_03570 " They whimpered silently because if they speak louder the King might know of it and they would face punishment " )
( train_bengalifemale_03571 " They thought it is not fair for the King Rayar to order so for transforming the barber into a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03572 " This might give way for many others to long for the wish This is against dharma " )
( train_bengalifemale_03573 " Thinking long in vain about what they were to do they approached Raman seeking a solution " )
( train_bengalifemale_03574 " Understanding the whole episode Raman tried to inject some confidence into the members of the Brahmin community " )
( train_bengalifemale_03575 " He told them All of you have some peace and rest " )
( train_bengalifemale_03576 " I will try my best to avert this extreme incident from happening " )
( train_bengalifemale_03577 " The next morning the Brahmins who were ordered on to the job took the barber to the Coast of a River " )
( train_bengalifemale_03578 " There they started chanting some mantras standing around him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03579 " King Rayarr was watching the performance sitting at a distance and was supervising what was happening " )
( train_bengalifemale_03580 " King Rayar stopped laughing and started to think " )
( train_bengalifemale_03581 " He understood that Raman was doing this to open his eyes " )
( train_bengalifemale_03582 " Immediately he called the barber and told him barber it is not possible to turn you as a Brahmin " )
( train_bengalifemale_03583 " Leaving this desire ask for another one " )
( train_bengalifemale_03584 " The barber submissively saluted Master I am happy with your kindness I do not need anything and left for home " )
( train_bengalifemale_03585 " Rayar as usual felicitated Raman for opening his eyes and protecting him from doing things against the Dharma " )
( train_bengalifemale_03586 " Story of Raman's prostrate adoration to donkeys " )
( train_bengalifemale_03587 " There was a royal teacher to the King Sri Rayarr " )
( train_bengalifemale_03588 " He was by practice and was having a defiant opinion and behaviour " )
( train_bengalifemale_03589 " While moving out he used to cover his head and face with his upper garment to avoid seeing others in the town unnecessarily " )
( train_bengalifemale_03590 " People watching the teacher doing this time and again titled him unofficially as stupid " )
( train_bengalifemale_03591 " The other learned persons were finding ways to teach a lesson to the teacher " )
( train_bengalifemale_03592 " They could not decide upon how and when to make tit for tat " )
( train_bengalifemale_03593 " The scare spread among them was that this teacher was the royal teacher to the King Rayar and his family " )
( train_bengalifemale_03594 " If something goes wrong and kindles the King's fury who should face it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03595 " With all these thoughts they started searching for someone who would be efficient to do this job for them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03596 " Their search ended after touring and scanning all the faces in the kingdom " )
( train_bengalifemale_03597 " That face belonged to Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03598 " In a group all the learned people went to Raman's residence to see him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03599 " Raman was a little surprised to see all of them together at his threshold " )
( train_bengalifemale_03600 " Clipping some smiles on his lips Raman invited them folding hands to the scholar's battalion " )
( train_bengalifemale_03601 " He invited them saying Welcome to you all the learned persons of the capital city " )
( train_bengalifemale_03602 " It is my pleasure to see you all together " )
( train_bengalifemale_03603 " One among the scholars took the initiative to explain the problem that was boggling their minds Raman We are all here to discuss a problem with you seeking a solution " )
( train_bengalifemale_03604 " The royal teacher is behaving beyond limits and is humiliating others regularly " )
( train_bengalifemale_03605 " This might end up elsewhere if he is not taught a right lesson " )
( train_bengalifemale_03606 " We all strongly believe that you are the right man who can do it in a sensible way " )
( train_bengalifemale_03607 " Please do not dishearten us " )
( train_bengalifemale_03608 " You should take this matter up " )
( train_bengalifemale_03609 " Another scholar also supported the previous one " )
( train_bengalifemale_03610 " You should plunge into action for a right solution to this problem " )
( train_bengalifemale_03611 " Raman thought for a while when all the other members of the group were coming out with one or the other statement against the teacher " )
( train_bengalifemale_03612 " Raman assured them All of you have put a heavy and burdensome job on my shoulders " )
( train_bengalifemale_03613 " Let me see what I can do about this " )
( train_bengalifemale_03614 " This is all the blessings of God " )
( train_bengalifemale_03615 " You do not worry I will take care of the teacher and his religious proudness " )
( train_bengalifemale_03616 " Though Raman personally watched the teacher's misbehavior towards other religions and practices he could not do anything " )
( train_bengalifemale_03617 " Now the time has come Nevertheless how to go about this " )
( train_bengalifemale_03618 " What would happen if King Rayar is irked on taking the teacher to task " )
( train_bengalifemale_03619 " Raman was waiting for the time to tune " )
( train_bengalifemale_03620 " While all this was going on King Rayar learnt about the indecent mannerisms of the teacher " )
( train_bengalifemale_03621 " He was hurt with the behaviour of the teacher and thought that if this continued it might give way to communal differences in the kingdom " )
( train_bengalifemale_03622 " Thinking so Rayar summoned Raman to his private chamber in the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_03623 " Raman was present before the King as quickly as possible after hearing the call " )
( train_bengalifemale_03624 " Raman King Rayar said in a low tone I wish to discuss an important issue with you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03625 " Yes My Lord replied Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03626 " This is a matter that should be handled completely undercover " )
( train_bengalifemale_03627 " I thought you were efficient to handle this matter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03628 " I am assigning this job to you said rayar " )
( train_bengalifemale_03629 " Yes my king every word of yours is an order for me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03630 " It came to my knowledge that the royal teacher is humiliating " )
( train_bengalifemale_03631 " I also noted that people are disgusted with him for this in fact some of the courtiers also pleaded with me to handle him and stop him from doing so " )
( train_bengalifemale_03632 " He is my family master and an elderly person " )
( train_bengalifemale_03633 " Think wise and do something to stop him from continuing with this Rayar ordered Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03634 " Raman promised the King My Lord I will do my best to solve the problem and bring some change in the ideology of the teacher " )
( train_bengalifemale_03635 " Leaving the palace Raman was overwhelmed with joy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03636 " He was waiting for a right opportunity and it has come his way in the form of King's order " )
( train_bengalifemale_03637 " The next morning Raman went to see the teacher " )
( train_bengalifemale_03638 " No sooner had Raman approached the main gate than he could see the teacher coming out of the house " )
( train_bengalifemale_03639 " While approaching the gate the teacher watching Raman standing there took his upper garment and started covering his face " )
( train_bengalifemale_03640 " Raman immediately said in a loud tone Excuse me Master I am a beloved disciple for you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03641 " Why is it that you are covering your face on seeing me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03642 " The teacher replied Raman I will tell you a secret just because you are my beloved disciple " )
( train_bengalifemale_03643 " Other cultures are sin filled " )
( train_bengalifemale_03644 " Anyone who sees those people will be born as a donkey in his or her next birth " )
( train_bengalifemale_03645 " That is why I protect myself by covering my face from attracting the sin of seeing others " )
( train_bengalifemale_03646 " Keep this to yourself and do not reveal it anywhere " )
( train_bengalifemale_03647 " Raman was more humble then My dear master You know me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03648 " If I hear something that totally remains within me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03649 " That will not come out even after my death " )
( train_bengalifemale_03650 " You do not have to worry about this " )
( train_bengalifemale_03651 " Now if you permit me I will take leave " )
( train_bengalifemale_03652 " Go ahead the teacher sent him off " )
( train_bengalifemale_03653 " On way home Raman was almost jumping with joy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03654 " All these days he was breaking his head to find ways to teach a lesson " )
( train_bengalifemale_03655 " That was a fine day because the teacher himself guided him for an excellent way " )
( train_bengalifemale_03656 " Ten days passed off Coolly with Raman waiting for an opportunity " )
( train_bengalifemale_03657 " On the eleventh day King Rayar along with the teacher eight scholars and other scholars visited a garden on the outskirts of the city as part of his relaxing routines " )
( train_bengalifemale_03658 " The day was spent off in a pleasurable manner " )
( train_bengalifemale_03659 " While all of them were returning a herd of donkeys were seen coming in the opposite direction " )
( train_bengalifemale_03660 " Immediately Raman ran from behind the King and started paying prostrate homage to the donkeys falling on the ground before the herd " )
( train_bengalifemale_03661 " King Rayar was completely surprised with his behaviour " )
( train_bengalifemale_03662 " He shouted Raman have you gone mad " )
( train_bengalifemale_03663 " Why are you saluting those donkeys " )
( train_bengalifemale_03664 " This donkey is the teacher's brother in law " )
( train_bengalifemale_03665 " That one his grandfather that stout one is his maternal uncle and the one with those spots is the teacher's father " )
( train_bengalifemale_03666 " Raman continued I am blessed to see all these persons reborn as donkeys " )
( train_bengalifemale_03667 " They are here in this form for the sin of looking at other religious and cultural followers in their previous birth " )
( train_bengalifemale_03668 " I am pleased to see all of them together " )
( train_bengalifemale_03669 " Please My King do not mistake me I am not lying " )
( train_bengalifemale_03670 " You can confirm this with the respected royal teacher " )
( train_bengalifemale_03671 " He has the practice of covering his face to protect himself from this happening " )
( train_bengalifemale_03672 " King Rayar looked at the teacher who had already hung his chin down in shame " )
( train_bengalifemale_03673 " Since then the teacher stopped both humiliating and covering his face on looking at people belonging to other traditions and cultures " )
( train_bengalifemale_03674 " The King felicitated with a great gift to Raman in his private chamber for treating the royal master with a right lesson " )
( train_bengalifemale_03675 " Once Rayar had a wonderful dream " )
( train_bengalifemale_03676 " He dreamt of a beautiful palace made of glittering stones which floated in the air " )
( train_bengalifemale_03677 " The palace had everything that one could ever wish for " )
( train_bengalifemale_03678 " It could be lit up with a thousand lights or made to disappear into the darkness by merely wishing so " )
( train_bengalifemale_03679 " The palace glistened and glowed and whoever entered the palace felt themselves in heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_03680 " But suddenly the dream ended and the palace vanished The king woke up with a start " )
( train_bengalifemale_03681 " The image of the palace was stuck in his mind " )
( train_bengalifemale_03682 " He could not forget the dream palace and one day he summoned all his courtiers and told them about his dream " )
( train_bengalifemale_03683 " Then the King then made a public announcement saying If someone can make such a palace for me I will give a hundred thousand gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_03684 " The courtiers who had been singing praises of the King's dream till then stopped mid-sentence " )
( train_bengalifemale_03685 " Their mouths fell open and each of them thought Is the King mad What on earth does he want us to build " )
( train_bengalifemale_03686 " Whoever heard of a palace floating in air The King is indeed insane " )
( train_bengalifemale_03687 " But no one had the courage to say so Many of King's well-wishers told him that such a palace could only exist in dreams " )
( train_bengalifemale_03688 " But alas the King was in one of his fanciful moods and he refused to listen " )
( train_bengalifemale_03689 " He insisted that it could be built and he also threatened his courtiers with dire consequences if they did not produce someone who could make the dream come true " )
( train_bengalifemale_03690 " The courtiers were aghast and worried And when none of them could come up with a solution they decided to approach Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03691 " Raman listened to the story and assured them saying Give me a week's time I shall cure the King of his fanciful notions " )
( train_bengalifemale_03692 " Till then let no one know that you have approached me " )
( train_bengalifemale_03693 " A few days later a very old man tottered into the King's court " )
( train_bengalifemale_03694 " He cried My Lord My Lord I need justice I need your justice " )
( train_bengalifemale_03695 " King asked Old man what is the problem Tell me without fear and I shall see that justice is done " )
( train_bengalifemale_03696 " I have been looted Your Majesty wailed the old man All my savings are gone I have nothing left " )
( train_bengalifemale_03697 " Who looted you thundered the King You name him and I will have him hanged immediately " )
( train_bengalifemale_03698 " Your Majesty If you don't take it as a personal affront I will tell you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03699 " But you must assure that you won't punish me mumbled the old man " )
( train_bengalifemale_03700 " Yes yes I promise replied the King " )
( train_bengalifemale_03701 " It's you my Lord said the old man " )
( train_bengalifemale_03702 " Me How dare you You insolent began the King but then he remembered his promise and sat back " )
( train_bengalifemale_03703 " Your Majesty Last night I had a dream It was quite terrifying " )
( train_bengalifemale_03704 " I dreamt that you would come with your entourage of ministers and commanders and loot my entire life's savings five thousand gold coins said the old man " )
( train_bengalifemale_03705 " You are a fool indeed roared the King It was just a dream you had " )
( train_bengalifemale_03706 " How can you be so stupid as to pretend that your dream is reality " )
( train_bengalifemale_03707 " Dreams are not true Anyone and everyone knows that " )
( train_bengalifemale_03708 " But they are Your Majesty Dreams are very true I am sure you know that " )
( train_bengalifemale_03709 " If your dream of a palace hanging in air can come true why can't my dream come true " )
( train_bengalifemale_03710 " The King was stunned by the old man's words " )
( train_bengalifemale_03711 " Before he could fully comprehend and recover from what the old man was saying the man tore off his beard and hair and stood before the King " )
( train_bengalifemale_03712 " It was none other than his favourite minister Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03713 " Bowing low before the amazed King Raman said Your Majesty " )
( train_bengalifemale_03714 " This was the only way of convincing you about the absurdity of your wish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03715 " Please forgive me if I have dishonoured you I do hope you understand the impossibility " )
( train_bengalifemale_03716 " You are right Raman agreed the King and burst into laughter You are really very shrewd " )
( train_bengalifemale_03717 " I am proud to have you in my court saying this King presented Raman with a Diamond ring and one thousand gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_03718 " Long long ago there was a man called Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03719 " He was minister to a great king called Rayar " )
( train_bengalifemale_03720 " He was supposed to be very clever " )
( train_bengalifemale_03721 " Once in that city there were a lot of problems due to rats " )
( train_bengalifemale_03722 " Rats were everywhere They were eating all sorts of books papers and grains " )
( train_bengalifemale_03723 " They also used to make holes in wooden shelves " )
( train_bengalifemale_03724 " Sometimes they even nibbled the ears of little children " )
( train_bengalifemale_03725 " Everybody knows that cats Kill rats " )
( train_bengalifemale_03726 " But there were so many rats in the city but very few cats " )
( train_bengalifemale_03727 " So the king asked every house in the city to grow cats " )
( train_bengalifemale_03728 " But cats need milk to drink Most of the houses did not have cows " )
( train_bengalifemale_03729 " So the king gave cows to every house and asked them to grow them too " )
( train_bengalifemale_03730 " All people were happy and used to give cats lot of milk to drink " )
( train_bengalifemale_03731 " Raman was a lazy man and liked to drink milk " )
( train_bengalifemale_03732 " So the first day he boiled the milk and poured it in a pan " )
( train_bengalifemale_03733 " He gave the piping hot milk to the cat " )
( train_bengalifemale_03734 " The cat which was hungry came and sipped the milk from the pan " )
( train_bengalifemale_03735 " Since the milk was hot it burnt its mouth The cat ran away " )
( train_bengalifemale_03736 " The next day and the next Raman did the same thing " )
( train_bengalifemale_03737 " After a few days he stopped giving milk to the cat and started drinking it himself " )
( train_bengalifemale_03738 " Raman's cat was lean and hungry and all other cats were stout and happy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03739 " One day the king wanted to see all the cats given by him and give prize to the fat cat " )
( train_bengalifemale_03740 " He was very angry with Raman for not growing his cat properly " )
( train_bengalifemale_03741 " Then Raman told the king that he was not lucky since his cat did not drink any milk " )
( train_bengalifemale_03742 " The king wanted to put Raman in Jail for telling a lie and wanted him to prove what he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_03743 " Then Raman brought the pan of milk and his cat " )
( train_bengalifemale_03744 " The cat on seeing the milk ran away " )
( train_bengalifemale_03745 " It thought that it was being given hot milk again " )
( train_bengalifemale_03746 " The king pitied Raman and let him away " )
( train_bengalifemale_03747 " The clever Raman lived happily forever drinking lots and lots of milk " )
( train_bengalifemale_03748 " Before getting a position in Rayar's court and heart Raman was very lazy and never did any work " )
( train_bengalifemale_03749 " One day he met a sage who taught Raman a secret Mantra and asked him to chant it thousand times in front of goddess Kali " )
( train_bengalifemale_03750 " That night after the whole household went to sleep " )
( train_bengalifemale_03751 " Raman crept out of his bed and made his way to the Kali temple " )
( train_bengalifemale_03752 " He chanted the mantra with great devotion " )
( train_bengalifemale_03753 " To his surprise goddess Kali with all her thousand heads stood in front of him when he finished chanting " )
( train_bengalifemale_03754 " When his eyes fell on the goddess he started to laugh this infuriated the goddess who demanded him to explain himself " )
( train_bengalifemale_03755 " Raman begged her pardon and said that it was just that it suddenly occurred to him that when he has a cold it is difficult enough to wipe one running nose " )
( train_bengalifemale_03756 " He said that he wondered what the goddess would do if she ever caught a cold since she had thousand heads " )
( train_bengalifemale_03757 " The goddess couldn't help smiling at this reply and gave him a boon by which he will always make others happy with his wit " )
( train_bengalifemale_03758 " She also said that henceforth he will be called Kavi " )
( train_bengalifemale_03759 " Raman was not satisfied with this boon he argued that it would do him no good " )
( train_bengalifemale_03760 " Then the goddess brought forth two bowls in her hand " )
( train_bengalifemale_03761 " One golden bowl containing the milk of wisdom and one silver bowl which had curds and stood for wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_03762 " These she offered to Raman and asked him to choose any one bowl and drink from it to be blessed with that boon " )
( train_bengalifemale_03763 " Raman tricked the goddess by quickly gulping down the contents of both the bowls " )
( train_bengalifemale_03764 " Again begged the goddess for forgiveness and explained that one without the other would be of little use " )
( train_bengalifemale_03765 " He argued that wealth without wisdom and wisdom without wealth would both bring unhappiness " )
( train_bengalifemale_03766 " The goddess relented and blessed him again with both the boons but she also warned him that to be so blessed will make others envious " )
( train_bengalifemale_03767 " Therefore he would make lot of enemies " )
( train_bengalifemale_03768 " But he should also have the wisdom to get out of any unpleasant situation " )
( train_bengalifemale_03769 " Since Raman hailed from the village and since he was blessed by goddess Kali he was called Kavi Raman " )
( train_bengalifemale_03770 " King had hung a huge bell in front of his palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_03771 " He announced that anyone seeking justice could ring the bell and their voice will be heard " )
( train_bengalifemale_03772 " One day the young prince went around the city in his chariot " )
( train_bengalifemale_03773 " People cheered him where ever he went and welcomed him by beating drums and with pipes " )
( train_bengalifemale_03774 " A young calf terrified with the loud noises ran berserk and got itself crushed under the wheels of the prince's chariot " )
( train_bengalifemale_03775 " The mother of the calf helplessly watched its little one die " )
( train_bengalifemale_03776 " The cow walked to the palace gates and rang the huge bell demanding justice from the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_03777 " The king came out and saw the cow he learnt from his courtiers the death of the young calf under the wheels of his son's chariot " )
( train_bengalifemale_03778 " King kept his promise " )
( train_bengalifemale_03779 " He ordered his son to be killed for his recklessness " )
( train_bengalifemale_03780 " The prince was killed the same way the calf had died " )
( train_bengalifemale_03781 " He was crushed under the wheels of the chariot " )
( train_bengalifemale_03782 " The king went through the same pain the cow had as he witnessed his son die and thereby being just at all cost " )
( train_bengalifemale_03783 " Long long ago there lived a boy called Peter " )
( train_bengalifemale_03784 " He was the only son of a poor and blind couple " )
( train_bengalifemale_03785 " Peter loved his parents and his sense of duty towards them was very high " )
( train_bengalifemale_03786 " He made it his life concern to take care of his blind parents " )
( train_bengalifemale_03787 " He tried to fulfill their every wish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03788 " One day his parents expressed their wish to go on a holy pilgrimage to Kasi " )
( train_bengalifemale_03789 " It was a prevalent belief among hindus that a dip in the holy river Ganges would rid them of a life time of bad karma " )
( train_bengalifemale_03790 " Peter at once made arrangements to take them He seated them in two baskets slung from either end of a wooden pole " )
( train_bengalifemale_03791 " He balanced that wooden pole upon his shoulders " )
( train_bengalifemale_03792 " The holy city of Kasi was a long way off " )
( train_bengalifemale_03793 " Peter had to walk day and night for long hours " )
( train_bengalifemale_03794 " One evening they reached a forest Peter's parents were very thirsty and they asked their son to fetch them some water " )
( train_bengalifemale_03795 " Peter left the baskets under a tree and went to a small stream to get water " )
( train_bengalifemale_03796 " At the same time in the forest the king was with his hunting party " )
( train_bengalifemale_03797 " King was celebrated for his fine marksmanship and could find his target just by hearing a merest whimper " )
( train_bengalifemale_03798 " As Peter was filling his pot it made a strange gurgling noise " )
( train_bengalifemale_03799 " King mistaking the noise for a wild beast aimed at the sound and shot his arrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03800 " Only when the arrow hit the mark and Peter let out a cry did king realize his mistake " )
( train_bengalifemale_03801 " He reached the spot as fast as he could and was disheartened to see that his arrow had pierced a young human " )
( train_bengalifemale_03802 " He tried to help Peter but it was too late " )
( train_bengalifemale_03803 " Peter wished King to take the water to his parents and died " )
( train_bengalifemale_03804 " King very ashamed to face Peter's parents went to them and offered the water and asked for their forgiveness for his terrible mistake " )
( train_bengalifemale_03805 " Peter's parents on learning that their sole caretaker and loving son gone would have none of King's apology " )
( train_bengalifemale_03806 " They cursed king to a similar fate as their's " )
( train_bengalifemale_03807 " Peter's father cursed that King would also die of grief from separation from his son " )
( train_bengalifemale_03808 " Both Peter's parents died of grief soon after " )
( train_bengalifemale_03809 " After many years the curse of Peter's parents came true " )
( train_bengalifemale_03810 " King too died of grief after his son Lord Rama went into exile to the forests for fourteen years " )
( train_bengalifemale_03811 " Raman was a clever and wittty person " )
( train_bengalifemale_03812 " He was the hearty friend of king Rayarr " )
( train_bengalifemale_03813 " The King often turned to Raman to help him out of difficult situations or solve a difficult problem " )
( train_bengalifemale_03814 " In Raman's city Ham fish was a very popular dish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03815 " Ham fish being available only once a year never failed to grab everyone's attention and interest " )
( train_bengalifemale_03816 " When it was Ham season house wives exchanged recipes shopkeepers discussed the latest price of Ham " )
( train_bengalifemale_03817 " Fishermen talked about catching the biggest Ham of the season " )
( train_bengalifemale_03818 " The King was surprised to see even his courtiers discussing Ham fish rather than more important state matters " )
( train_bengalifemale_03819 " Finally unable to bear this anymore he decided to put an end to all this talk about the fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03820 " He thought he would be at peace even if people would stop about it for a few minutes " )
( train_bengalifemale_03821 " He announced an award of fifty gold coins to anyone who could bring to the palace a big Ham fish from the market " )
( train_bengalifemale_03822 " The only condition being that while bringing the fish to the palace no passerby must talk about the fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03823 " Even after a week not one succeeded in this challenge " )
( train_bengalifemale_03824 " Simple as the task seemed many tried to attempt it but the look of Ham fish did not fail to excite remarks from onlookers " )
( train_bengalifemale_03825 " After a week Raman decided to take the challenge " )
( train_bengalifemale_03826 " He woke up one morning shaved off half of his beard " )
( train_bengalifemale_03827 " Put mud all over his face and hair put on old clothes and wore his shirt backwards " )
( train_bengalifemale_03828 " His wife when she looked at him demanded to know where he was going looking like a tramp " )
( train_bengalifemale_03829 " Raman simply smiled and said he was going to the market to buy the biggest Ham fish available " )
( train_bengalifemale_03830 " So saying he left her and headed to the market " )
( train_bengalifemale_03831 " There he bought a big Ham fishhe started walking towards the palace making very little effort to hide the fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03832 " On the way people who met him were shocked at Raman's appearance " )
( train_bengalifemale_03833 " They wondered if he had finally gone mad " )
( train_bengalifemale_03834 " What with mud on his face and his beard half shaven he did look strange " )
( train_bengalifemale_03835 " Some others feared that Raman had lost his memory " )
( train_bengalifemale_03836 " When Raman reached the palace gates the guards hardly recognised him and wouldn't let him inside " )
( train_bengalifemale_03837 " One guard went inside to inform the king and then the king summoned Raman inside " )
( train_bengalifemale_03838 " He took one look at Raman and was shocked to see his best advisor looking like a tramp " )
( train_bengalifemale_03839 " He demanded Raman to explain himself " )
( train_bengalifemale_03840 " Raman merely laughed and replied that he had won the challenge and the king owed him fifty gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_03841 " The king looked confused he wanted to know what challenge Raman was talking about " )
( train_bengalifemale_03842 " Raman unwrapped a big Ham fish from under his arms and showed it to the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_03843 " No one who had met him had spoken anything about the fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03844 " In fact no one had noticed the fish " )
( train_bengalifemale_03845 " Raman's looks had taken away all their attention " )
( train_bengalifemale_03846 " The king laughed at Raman's cleverness and gave Raman fifty gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_03847 " He also suggested him to go home at once and clean himself " )
( train_bengalifemale_03848 " Raman went home happier and richer " )
( train_bengalifemale_03849 " Once Akbar wanted to test his courtiers and so he put a question to all of them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03850 " Akbar asked What is the thing that travels fastest in the world " )
( train_bengalifemale_03851 " One of the courtiers said Bullock cart while another said wind and yet another said Light " )
( train_bengalifemale_03852 " Akbar was waiting for Birbal's answer " )
( train_bengalifemale_03853 " Birbal said Your majesty The thoughts in the mind are the fastest to travel " )
( train_bengalifemale_03854 " In a moment you are in this court and your next thought can be anywhere else in this world and therefore thought is the fastest thing in the world " )
( train_bengalifemale_03855 " Everyone was very surprised at Birbal's wisdom and Akbar proud of Birbal's wisdom rewarded him suitably " )
( train_bengalifemale_03856 " One day two merchants named Ramu and Shamu came to Akbar's court " )
( train_bengalifemale_03857 " Ramu spoke first He said Your Majesty This is my friend Shamu " )
( train_bengalifemale_03858 " I had given him my treasure before going on business work to another town " )
( train_bengalifemale_03859 " After returning from there when I ask him to return that he says that I never gave him anything " )
( train_bengalifemale_03860 " Shamu said No Your Majesty You can check my house Ramu never gave me any treasure He is lying " )
( train_bengalifemale_03861 " Akbar told his soldiers to check Shamu's house in the evening but the soldiers did not find anything " )
( train_bengalifemale_03862 " Ramu and Shamu were again in the court the next day and Akbar said we could not find anything in Shamu's house " )
( train_bengalifemale_03863 " So Ramu must be lying to which Ramu said No sir I am not lying " )
( train_bengalifemale_03864 " Birbal was listening and said Your Majesty Give me a chance to solve this case " )
( train_bengalifemale_03865 " Actually I have found the treasure and I have kept in my house I will submit it in the court tomorrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03866 " Hearing what Birbal had to say everyone was surprised and the court was adjourned " )
( train_bengalifemale_03867 " Ramu and Shamu left to their respective houses " )
( train_bengalifemale_03868 " Birbal asked the soldiers to follow Shamu in disguise " )
( train_bengalifemale_03869 " Shamu went home and after sometime he came out went into a forest and dug a place near a big Banyan tree " )
( train_bengalifemale_03870 " He took out a big bag in which there were ornaments and immediately the soldiers arrested him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03871 " They produced him in the court before the king " )
( train_bengalifemale_03872 " Birbal said Your Majesty yesterday I lied to you I did not find any treasure " )
( train_bengalifemale_03873 " I wanted to find out whether Shamu was innocent or if he was really hiding the treasure " )
( train_bengalifemale_03874 " But when I said so Shamu became anxious and went and checked the place for treasure where he had really hidden the treasure " )
( train_bengalifemale_03875 " So please arrest Shamu and handover this treasure to Ramu " )
( train_bengalifemale_03876 " Akbar was very happy with Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03877 " One day two women came to the court with a baby and both of them were crying " )
( train_bengalifemale_03878 " Akbar said What is your problem Why are you crying " )
( train_bengalifemale_03879 " One of the women said Your Majesty I am Sita and she is Gita " )
( train_bengalifemale_03880 " This is my baby But Gita says that my baby belongs to her " )
( train_bengalifemale_03881 " At this Gita interrupted and said No your Majesty this is my baby I have given birth to her " )
( train_bengalifemale_03882 " Saying this both of them started crying and quarrelling " )
( train_bengalifemale_03883 " As both of them did not belong to this town there was nobody who knew them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03884 " Everyone anxiously looked at Birbal awaiting a brilliant solution to this challenging problem " )
( train_bengalifemale_03885 " Birbal whispered something to the soldier and He went and came back with a sword " )
( train_bengalifemale_03886 " Birbal said to the women as both of you claim to be the mother of this child I have decided to give it to both of you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03887 " I will cut this baby into half and give both of you " )
( train_bengalifemale_03888 " Saying so he raised the sword to cut the baby " )
( train_bengalifemale_03889 " Sita came running to Birbal held his hand and said Please spare my baby Let Gita have this baby " )
( train_bengalifemale_03890 " Birbal handed over the baby to Sita and said No mother wants to have her baby killed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03891 " She does not want to cause harm to her innocent baby and so Sita reacted immediately while Gita did not " )
( train_bengalifemale_03892 " Hence Sita only can be this child's mother and so Gita was arrested " )
( train_bengalifemale_03893 " Everyone was amazed at Birbal's wisdom gave a standing ovation to Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03894 " One day a person from neighboring kingdom came to Akbar's court " )
( train_bengalifemale_03895 " He wanted to test Birbal as his popularity was widespread and He requested Akbar to allow him to give a task to Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03896 " Akbar was very confident about Birbal and hence agreed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03897 " The person showed everyone in the court a small stick and He asked Birbal to make it a long stick " )
( train_bengalifemale_03898 " Everyone was very surprised as to how that was possible and Akbar looked at Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03899 " Birbal came forward and took another similar stick and then broke this stick into a size smaller than the stick brought by the person " )
( train_bengalifemale_03900 " He kept both the sticks beside each other and asked everyone including the person Which is the long stick " )
( train_bengalifemale_03901 " Everyone said that the stick brought by the person is the long stick " )
( train_bengalifemale_03902 " Birbal smiled and said to the person see I have made the stick brought by you longer " )
( train_bengalifemale_03903 " Everyone including the person praised Birbal for his wisdom " )
( train_bengalifemale_03904 " Akbar was very close to his minister Birbal because of which many of the other ministers were jealous of Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03905 " One day they went to the king and said Your Majesty We know that you like Birbal very much as he is very clever and intelligent " )
( train_bengalifemale_03906 " Please give us a test to prove our talent " )
( train_bengalifemale_03907 " Akbar thought for a while and said Tomorrow in the court I will give you a task and Let us see who will come up with the solution first " )
( train_bengalifemale_03908 " At this the ministers gladly agreed and left " )
( train_bengalifemale_03909 " In the court next day Akbar said Here is the test for all the ministers in the court " )
( train_bengalifemale_03910 " Count the number of crows in the city I want to have the solution by tomorrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_03911 " Everybody in the court was astonished by the task and thought Is the king serious " )
( train_bengalifemale_03912 " Birbal was very cool he went home had his lunch and enjoyed in the park that evening while all the others were very busy " )
( train_bengalifemale_03913 " They started counting the crows in the city and some did not have their lunch because after all they had to outwit Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03914 " Next day the king was ready in the court and everybody except Birbal were pale " )
( train_bengalifemale_03915 " The ministers said Sorry Your Majesty We could not complete your task perfectly " )
( train_bengalifemale_03916 " We failed to count the crows exactly and We all have come up with different solutions " )
( train_bengalifemale_03917 " Akbar turned to Birbal and Birbal said Sir there are 5248 crows in the city " )
( train_bengalifemale_03918 " Hearing this everyone was puzzled and Akbar asked Birbal how he could be so sure " )
( train_bengalifemale_03919 " Birbal said Sir if there are any less crows than the above figure I mentioned it means that they have gone to their relatives' town " )
( train_bengalifemale_03920 " If there are more crows than the number I have given it means that some crows have come to visit their relatives from other towns to our city " )
( train_bengalifemale_03921 " Listening to this Akbar started laughing loudly and so did everyone in the court " )
( train_bengalifemale_03922 " The ministers realized that the king wanted such a logical and witty reply and not the exact statistics of the crows in the town " )
( train_bengalifemale_03923 " As we all know Birbal was not only Emperor Akbar's favourite minister but also a minister dearly loved by most of the commoners because of his ready wit and wisdom " )
( train_bengalifemale_03924 " People used to come to him from far and wide for advise on personal matters too " )
( train_bengalifemale_03925 " However there was a group of ministers that were jealous of his growing popularity and disliked him intensely " )
( train_bengalifemale_03926 " They outwardly showered him with praise and compliments but on the inside they began to hatch a plot to kill him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03927 " One day they approached the king's barber with a plan " )
( train_bengalifemale_03928 " As the barber was extremely close to the king they asked him to help them get rid of Birbal permanently and of course they promised him a huge sum of money in return " )
( train_bengalifemale_03929 " The wicked barber readily agreed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03930 " The next time the king required his services the barber started a conversation about the emperor's father who he also used to serve " )
( train_bengalifemale_03931 " He sang praises of his fine silky-smooth hair and then as an afterthought he asked the king that as he was enjoying such great prosperity had he made an attempt to do anything for the welfare of his ancestors " )
( train_bengalifemale_03932 " The king was furious at such impertinent stupidity and told the barber that it was not possible to do anything because they were already dead " )
( train_bengalifemale_03933 " The barber mentioned that he knew of a magician who could come of help " )
( train_bengalifemale_03934 " The magician could send a person up to heaven to enquire about his father's welfare " )
( train_bengalifemale_03935 " But of course this person would have to be chosen carefully; he would have to be intelligent enough to follow the magicians instructions as well as make on-the-spot decisions " )
( train_bengalifemale_03936 " He must be wise intelligent and responsible " )
( train_bengalifemale_03937 " The barber then suggested the best person for the job was the wisest of all ministers Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03938 " The king was very excited about hearing from his dead father and asked the barber to go ahead and make the arrangements immediately " )
( train_bengalifemale_03939 " He asked him what was needed to be done and the barber explained that they would take Birbal in a procession to the burial grounds and light a pyre " )
( train_bengalifemale_03940 " The magician would then chant some mantras as Birbal would ascend to the heavens through the smoke " )
( train_bengalifemale_03941 " The chantings would help protect Birbal from the fire " )
( train_bengalifemale_03942 " The king happily informed Birbal of this plan and Birbal said that he thought it a brilliant idea and wanted to know the brain behind it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03943 " When learning that it was the barber's idea he agreed to go to heaven on condition that he be given a large sum of money for the long journey as well as one month's time to settle his family so that they had no trouble while he was gone " )
( train_bengalifemale_03944 " The king agreed to both conditions " )
( train_bengalifemale_03945 " In the duration of this month he got a few trustworthy men to build a tunnel from the funeral grounds to his house " )
( train_bengalifemale_03946 " And on the day of the ascension after the pyre had been lit Birbal escaped through the concealed door of the tunnel " )
( train_bengalifemale_03947 " He disappeared in to his house where he hid for a few months while his hair and beard grew long and unruly " )
( train_bengalifemale_03948 " In the meantime his enemies were rejoicing as they thought that they had seen the last of Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03949 " Then one day after many many months Birbal arrived at the palace with news of the king's father " )
( train_bengalifemale_03950 " The king was extremely pleased to see him and ready with a barrage of questions " )
( train_bengalifemale_03951 " Birbal told the king that his father was in the best of spirits and had been provided with all the comforts except one " )
( train_bengalifemale_03952 " The king wanted to know what was lacking because now he thought he had found a way to send things and people to heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_03953 " Birbal answered that there were no barbers in heaven which is why even he was forced to grow his own beard " )
( train_bengalifemale_03954 " He said that his father had asked for a good barber " )
( train_bengalifemale_03955 " So the king decided to send his own barber to serve his father in heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_03956 " He called both the barber and the magician to prepare to send him to heaven " )
( train_bengalifemale_03957 " The barber could say absolutely nothing in his own defence as he was caught in his own trap and once the pyre was lit he died on the spot " )
( train_bengalifemale_03958 " Nobody dared to conspire against Birbal again " )
( train_bengalifemale_03959 " In the town of Agra there lived a rich businessman who was also quite a miser " )
( train_bengalifemale_03960 " Various people used to flock outside his house everyday hoping for some kind of generosity but they always had to return home disappointed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03961 " He used to ward them off with false promises and then never live up to his word " )
( train_bengalifemale_03962 " Then one day a poet named Kavi arrived at his house and said that he wanted to read out his poems to the rich man " )
( train_bengalifemale_03963 " As the rich man was very fond of poetry he welcomed him in with open arms " )
( train_bengalifemale_03964 " Kavi started to recite all his poems one by one at which the rich man was very pleased " )
( train_bengalifemale_03965 " More so when he heard the poem that Kavi had written on him because he had been compared with the god of wealth " )
( train_bengalifemale_03966 " In those days it was a custom for rich men and kings to show their appreciation through a reward or a gift as that was the only means of earning that a poor poet possessed " )
( train_bengalifemale_03967 " So the rich man promised Kavi some gifts and asked him to come and collect them the next day and Kavi was pleased " )
( train_bengalifemale_03968 " The next morning when he arrived at the house the rich man pretended that he had never laid eyes on him before " )
( train_bengalifemale_03969 " When Kavi reminded him of his promise he said that although Kavi was a good poet he understood very little of human nature " )
( train_bengalifemale_03970 " And that if rich businessman truly wanted to reward him he would have done so the very same night " )
( train_bengalifemale_03971 " Kavi had been offered a reward not because he was really pleased or impressed but to simply encourage him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03972 " Kavi was extremely upset but as there was nothing that he could do he quietly left the house " )
( train_bengalifemale_03973 " On his way home he saw Birbal riding a horse so he stopped him and asked for his help after narrating the whole incident " )
( train_bengalifemale_03974 " Birbal took him to his own house in order to come up with a plan " )
( train_bengalifemale_03975 " After giving it some thought he asked Kavi to go to a friend's house with five gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_03976 " Request the friend to plan a dinner on the coming full moon night where the rich man would also be invited he said " )
( train_bengalifemale_03977 " Birbal then asked Kavi to relax and leave the rest to him " )
( train_bengalifemale_03978 " Kavi had one trustworthy friend whose name was Midas so he went up to him and told him the plan " )
( train_bengalifemale_03979 " The next day Midas went to the rich man's house and invited him for dinner " )
( train_bengalifemale_03980 " The dinner has been planned for the coming full moon night " )
( train_bengalifemale_03981 " He said that he intended to serve his guests in vessels of gold which the guests would get to take home after the meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_03982 " The rich man was thrilled to hear this and jumped at the offer " )
( train_bengalifemale_03983 " After sunset on the full moon night the rich man arrived at Midas house and was surprised to see no other guests there but Kavi " )
( train_bengalifemale_03984 " Anyhow they welcomed him in and started a polite conversation " )
( train_bengalifemale_03985 " The rich man had come on an empty stomach and so was getting hungrier by the minute " )
( train_bengalifemale_03986 " Kavi and Midas were quite full as they had eaten just before the rich man's arrival " )
( train_bengalifemale_03987 " Finally at midnight the rich man could bear his hunger no longer and asked Midas to serve the food " )
( train_bengalifemale_03988 " Midas sounded extremely surprised when he asked him what food he was talking about " )
( train_bengalifemale_03989 " The rich man tried to remind him that he had been invited for dinner " )
( train_bengalifemale_03990 " At this point Kavi asked him for proof of the invitation and the rich man had no answer " )
( train_bengalifemale_03991 " Then Midas told him that he had just invited him to please him and had not really meant it " )
( train_bengalifemale_03992 " He then went on to say that even though they did not do anything good for other people they also would never try to hurt another human being " )
( train_bengalifemale_03993 " He asked the rich man not to feel bad " )
( train_bengalifemale_03994 " At that point Birbal walked into the room and reminded the rich man of the same treatment that he had himself meted out to Kavi " )
( train_bengalifemale_03995 " The rich man realised his mistake and begged for forgiveness " )
( train_bengalifemale_03996 " He said that Kavi was a good poet and had not asked him for any reward " )
( train_bengalifemale_03997 " He himself had promised to give him some gifts and then cheated him out of them " )
( train_bengalifemale_03998 " To make up for his mistake he took out the necklace that he was wearing and gifted it to Kavi " )
( train_bengalifemale_03999 " Then they all sat down to eat a happy meal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04000 " Kavi was all praise for Birbal and thanked him profusely and Emperor Akbar also invited him to his court and honored him all thanks to Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04001 " Once a rich merchant's house was robbed " )
( train_bengalifemale_04002 " The merchant suspected that the thief was one of his servants so he went to Birbal and mentioned the incident " )
( train_bengalifemale_04003 " Birbal went to his house and assembled all of his servants and asked that who stole the merchant's things and everybody denied " )
( train_bengalifemale_04004 " Birbal thought for a moment then gave a stick of equal length to all the servants of the merchant and said to them the stick of the real thief will be longer by two inches tomorrow " )
( train_bengalifemale_04005 " All the servants should be present here again tomorrow with heir sticks " )
( train_bengalifemale_04006 " All the servants went to their homes and gathered again at the same place the next day " )
( train_bengalifemale_04007 " Birbal asked them to show him their sticks " )
( train_bengalifemale_04008 " One of the servants had his stick shorter by two inches " )
( train_bengalifemale_04009 " Seeing this Birbal said This is your thief merchant " )
( train_bengalifemale_04010 " Later the merchant asked Birbal How did you catch him " )
( train_bengalifemale_04011 " Birbal said The thief had already cut stick short by two inches in the night fearing that his stick will be longer by two inches by morning " )
( train_bengalifemale_04012 " Since Birbal always outwitted Akbar Akbar thought of a plan to make Birbal look like a fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_04013 " So when Birbal arrived the king narrated a dream he had the previous night saying that he would be able to judge the honesty of his ministers if they were able to bring back an egg from the royal garden pond " )
( train_bengalifemale_04014 " So Akbar asked all his courtiers to go to the pond one at a time and return with an egg " )
( train_bengalifemale_04015 " So one by one all his ministers went to the pond and returned with the egg which he had previously given them " )
( train_bengalifemale_04016 " Then it was Birbal's turn but when he jumped into the pond he could find no eggs " )
( train_bengalifemale_04017 " He finally realized that the King was trying to play a trick on him and so he entered the court crowing like a cock " )
( train_bengalifemale_04018 " The Emperor asked him to stop making that irritating noise and then asked him for the egg " )
( train_bengalifemale_04019 " Birbal smiled and replied that only hens lay eggs as he was a cock he could not produce an egg " )
( train_bengalifemale_04020 " Everyone laughed loudly and the King realized that Birbal could never be easily fooled " )
( train_bengalifemale_04021 " Emperor Akbar's court was famous for its witty question and answer sessions " )
( train_bengalifemale_04022 " On one of these occasions the Emperor asked Birbal if there was anything that the sun and the moon could not see " )
( train_bengalifemale_04023 " Birbal's reply was darkness and Akbar was pleased " )
( train_bengalifemale_04024 " Next he asked what is the difference between a truth and a lie " )
( train_bengalifemale_04025 " To which Birbal replied that it was the distance between the ears and the eyes because what you see with your eyes is true but what you hear with your ears is generally false " )
( train_bengalifemale_04026 " Akbar was satisfied " )
( train_bengalifemale_04027 " Lastly Emperor Akbar drew a line on the floor and asked Birbal to shorten it without wiping out the ends " )
( train_bengalifemale_04028 " Birbal drew a longer line below the line drawn by Akbar and remarked that though he had not rubbed off the original line he had definitely succeeded in making it shorter " )
( train_bengalifemale_04029 " One night Emperor Akbar dreamt that he had lost all his teeth except one " )
( train_bengalifemale_04030 " The next morning he invited all the astrologers of his kingdom to interpret this dream " )
( train_bengalifemale_04031 " After a long discussion the astrologers prophesized that all his relatives would die before him " )
( train_bengalifemale_04032 " Akbar was very upset by this interpretation and so sent away all the astrologers without any reward " )
( train_bengalifemale_04033 " Later that day Birbal entered the court and Akbar related his dream and asked him to interpret it " )
( train_bengalifemale_04034 " After thinking for a while Birbal replied that the Emperor would live a longer & more fulfilled life than any of his relatives " )
( train_bengalifemale_04035 " Akbar was pleased with Birbal's explanation and rewarded him handsomely " )
( train_bengalifemale_04036 " King Akbar was very fond of Birbal and this made a certain courtier very jealous " )
( train_bengalifemale_04037 " Now this courtier always wanted to be chief minister but this was not possible as Birbal filled his position " )
( train_bengalifemale_04038 " One day Akbar praised Birbal in front of the courtier which made the courtier very angry " )
( train_bengalifemale_04039 " He said that the king praised Birbal unjustly and if Birbal could answer three of his questions he would accept the fact that Birbal was intelligent " )
( train_bengalifemale_04040 " Akbar always wanting to test Birbal's wit readily agreed " )
( train_bengalifemale_04041 " The three questions were How many stars are there in the sky Where is the centre of the Earth and How many men and how many women are there in the world " )
( train_bengalifemale_04042 " Immediately Akbar asked Birbal the three questions and informed him that if he could not answer them he would have to resign as chief minister " )
( train_bengalifemale_04043 " To answer the first question Birbal brought a hairy sheep and said there are as many stars in the sky as there is hair on the sheep's body " )
( train_bengalifemale_04044 " My friend the courtier is welcome to count them if he likes " )
( train_bengalifemale_04045 " To answer the second question Birbal drew a couple of lines on the floor and bore an iron rod in it and said that this is the centre of the Earth " )
( train_bengalifemale_04046 " In answer to the third question Birbal said Counting the exact number of men and women in the world would be a problem " )
( train_bengalifemale_04047 " There are some specimens like our courtier friend here who cannot easily be classified as either " )
( train_bengalifemale_04048 " Therefore if all people like him are killed then and only then can one count the exact number " )
( train_bengalifemale_04049 " On a cold winter day Akbar and Birbal took a walk along the lake " )
( train_bengalifemale_04050 " A thought came to Birbal that a man would do anything for money " )
( train_bengalifemale_04051 " He expressed his feelings to Akbar and Akbar then put his finger into the lake and immediately removed it because he shivered with cold " )
( train_bengalifemale_04052 " Akbar said I don't think a man would spend an entire night in the cold water of this lake for money " )
( train_bengalifemale_04053 " Birbal replied I am sure I can find such a person " )
( train_bengalifemale_04054 " Akbar then challenged Birbal into finding such a person and said that he would reward the person with a thousand gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_04055 " Birbal searched far and wide until he found a poor man who was desperate enough to accept the challenge " )
( train_bengalifemale_04056 " The poor man entered the lake and Akbar had guards posted near him to make sure that he really did as promised " )
( train_bengalifemale_04057 " The next morning the guards took the poor man to Akbar " )
( train_bengalifemale_04058 " Akbar asked the poor man if he had indeed spent the night in the lake " )
( train_bengalifemale_04059 " The poor man replied that he had and Akbar then asked the poor man how he managed to spend the night in the lake " )
( train_bengalifemale_04060 " The poor man replied that there was a street lamp nearby and that he kept his attention affixed on the lamp and away from the cold " )
( train_bengalifemale_04061 " Akbar then said that there would be no reward as the poor man had survived the night in the lake by the warmth of the street lamp " )
( train_bengalifemale_04062 " The poor man went to Birbal for help and so the next day Birbal did not go to court " )
( train_bengalifemale_04063 " The king wondering where he was sent a messenger to his home " )
( train_bengalifemale_04064 " The messenger came back saying that Birbal would come once his rice was cooked " )
( train_bengalifemale_04065 " The king waited hours but Birbal did not come " )
( train_bengalifemale_04066 " Finally the king decided to go to Birbal's house and see what he was upto " )
( train_bengalifemale_04067 " He found Birbal sitting on the floor near some burning twigs and a bowl filled with rice hanging five feet above the fire " )
( train_bengalifemale_04068 " The king and his attendants could not help but laugh " )
( train_bengalifemale_04069 " Akbar then said to Birbal How can the rice be cooked if it so far away from the fire " )
( train_bengalifemale_04070 " Birbal answered The same way the poor man received heat from a street lamp that was more than a furlong away " )
( train_bengalifemale_04071 " The King understood his mistake and gave the poor man his reward " )
( train_bengalifemale_04072 " Akbar loved hunting and used to escape to go for hunting even from his studies " )
( train_bengalifemale_04073 " Well later he became a better rider and hunter than any one of his courtiers " )
( train_bengalifemale_04074 " As the evening fell everybody got very hungry and thirsty they found that they had lost their way and now did not know where to go " )
( train_bengalifemale_04075 " At last they came to a junction of three roads " )
( train_bengalifemale_04076 " The king was very happy to see the roads that now he could go reach his capital through one of these roads but which road was to go to his capital Agra " )
( train_bengalifemale_04077 " They were all thinking about it and could not decide it " )
( train_bengalifemale_04078 " In the mean time they saw a young boy coming along one road " )
( train_bengalifemale_04079 " The boy was summoned and Akbar asked him Hey young boy Which road goes to Agra " )
( train_bengalifemale_04080 " The boy smiled and spoke everybody knows that road cannot move so how these roads can go to Agra or anywhere else and laughed at his own joke " )
( train_bengalifemale_04081 " Everybody was silent and didn't say a word so the boy said again people travel not the roads do they " )
( train_bengalifemale_04082 " Emperor laughed at this and said No you are right " )
( train_bengalifemale_04083 " The Emperor asked again What is your name young boy " )
( train_bengalifemale_04084 " Mahesh Das The boy replied and asked the Emperor And who are you What is your name " )
( train_bengalifemale_04085 " The Emperor took out his Ring and gave it to the boy saying You are talking to Emperor Akbar the King of India " )
( train_bengalifemale_04086 " We need fearless people like you so come to the court with this Ring I will recognize you immediately " )
( train_bengalifemale_04087 " Now tell me the way to get to Agra as we have to reach there soon " )
( train_bengalifemale_04088 " Mahesh Das bowing lowly pointed towards the road going to Agra and the King headed on that road " )
( train_bengalifemale_04089 " When he grew up as a fine young man he took all his savings along with the Ring of Seal of the Emperor Akbar " )
( train_bengalifemale_04090 " He bade his mother farewell and set out to the new capital of India " )
( train_bengalifemale_04091 " He was very much enchanted with the pomp and show of the new capital " )
( train_bengalifemale_04092 " He escaped the crowd and headed towards the red walls of the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_04093 " The palace gate was very richly ornamented a very beautiful gate as he had never seen before " )
( train_bengalifemale_04094 " Mahesh wanted to enter the gate but the guard slashed the air with his spear and stopped him from entering the gate " )
( train_bengalifemale_04095 " Where do you think you are going asked the guard to which Mahesh said politely Sir I have come to see the King " )
( train_bengalifemale_04096 " Oh yeah the King must be waiting for you as and when you would come the guard said sarcastically " )
( train_bengalifemale_04097 " Mahesh smiled at this comment and spoke Yes Sir and now I am here " )
( train_bengalifemale_04098 " Mahesh told further I am sure you must have fought wonderfully well on the Emperor's frontiers but do not risk your life by stopping me from entering the palace " )
( train_bengalifemale_04099 " The guard kept quiet for a moment then said courageously Why do you think so " )
( train_bengalifemale_04100 " I will chop off your head if you do not stop talking nonsense " )
( train_bengalifemale_04101 " Mahesh was not going to accept his defeat and he showed Akbar's Ring of Seal to the guard " )
( train_bengalifemale_04102 " Now who was the person who did not recognize Akbar's Ring of Seal Having seen the seal the guard couldn't say a word " )
( train_bengalifemale_04103 " He had to admit him although he was not willing to do it and So the guard thought and thought then he said to Mahesh You can go in on one condition " )
( train_bengalifemale_04104 " The guard said Whatever you will get from the Emperor you will share with me half of that " )
( train_bengalifemale_04105 " Agreed Mahesh smiled and the guard let him go inside " )
( train_bengalifemale_04106 " He went on and on finally he could see the golden throne on which a man of simple elegance was sitting " )
( train_bengalifemale_04107 " He quickly recognized him as the Emperor Akbar " )
( train_bengalifemale_04108 " Pushing everyone aside Mahesh went further and prostrated himself before the Emperor Akbar and said May your shadow always grow O Full Moon " )
( train_bengalifemale_04109 " Akbar smiled and asked him What do you want young man " )
( train_bengalifemale_04110 " Mahesh rose to his feet and spoke Sir I have come here at your command And he handed over the Ring of Seal which was given to him by the King some years before " )
( train_bengalifemale_04111 " That's a good boy now what do you want What is your heart's desire Tell me I will try my best to fulfill it " )
( train_bengalifemale_04112 " Mahesh remembered his promise with the guard so he asked the Emperor to punish him with one hundred slashes " )
( train_bengalifemale_04113 " The King was surprised to hear that But how can I do this to you you have done nothing wrong " )
( train_bengalifemale_04114 " Mahesh said politely Sir please do not go back from your promise of fulfilling my heart's desire " )
( train_bengalifemale_04115 " So with great reluctance and perplexed mind Akbar ordered one hundred lashes on Mahesh's back " )
( train_bengalifemale_04116 " To the surprise of all Mahesh endured every stroke without uttering a word " )
( train_bengalifemale_04117 " After the fiftieth whip he suddenly shouted Stop now " )
( train_bengalifemale_04118 " Akbar asked him why he wanted to stop and what had happened " )
( train_bengalifemale_04119 " Mahesh said Sir when I was coming here your guard did not allow me to come inside the palace unless I promised him to give half of my share of whatever I will get from you " )
( train_bengalifemale_04120 " I have taken half of my share now it is your guard's turn to take his share of half " )
( train_bengalifemale_04121 " Hearing this everybody at the court burst into laughter " )
( train_bengalifemale_04122 " The guard was hauled to receive his humiliating bribe " )
( train_bengalifemale_04123 " The King said You are as brave as you were when you were a child and you have grown into a cleverer young man " )
( train_bengalifemale_04124 " I was trying to weed out the corrupted people from my court but your little trick has done what I wouldn't have done even after passing several laws " )
( train_bengalifemale_04125 " From now on on the basis of your wisdom you shall be called Birbal and you will stay by my side as my advisor " )
( train_bengalifemale_04126 " That is how Birbal was born " )
( train_bengalifemale_04127 " Akbar was very impressed with Birbal's wit and wisdom so one day Akbar promised him for many gifts " )
( train_bengalifemale_04128 " But it so happened that several days passed but there was no sign of gift and Birbal was very disappointed He didn't know what to do " )
( train_bengalifemale_04129 " One day when Akbar was taking a stroll at the bank of Yamuna with his dear minister Birbal he happened to notice a camel " )
( train_bengalifemale_04130 " He asked Birbal Tell me Birbal why the camel's neck is crooked " )
( train_bengalifemale_04131 " Birbal thought this is good time so he thought for a moment and spoke Your Majesty " )
( train_bengalifemale_04132 " It might be possible that the camel has forgotten to honor his promise made to somebody that is why his neck is crooked " )
( train_bengalifemale_04133 " Scriptures mention that whoever will forget their promises will have crooked neck so this might seem the reason of his crooked neck " )
( train_bengalifemale_04134 " Akbar soon realized that he promised to give some gifts to Birbal but has not yet done so " )
( train_bengalifemale_04135 " As soon as they arrived at the palace the King gave him his reward " )
( train_bengalifemale_04136 " So Birbal was so wise that he got what he wanted without asking for it " )
( train_bengalifemale_04137 " One day Akbar was taking a walk in his Royal gardens with several courtiers " )
( train_bengalifemale_04138 " Many flowers were flowering at that time of season " )
( train_bengalifemale_04139 " A poet pointed out towards a beautiful flower and said Look how beautiful flower that is No man can produce such a beautiful thing as this " )
( train_bengalifemale_04140 " Birbal was also there and he said I don't agree with this sometimes man can make more beautiful things than this " )
( train_bengalifemale_04141 " Akbar said Oh no Birbal you are talking nonsense this flower is really very beautiful " )
( train_bengalifemale_04142 " After a few days Birbal presented Akbar a very skilled craftsman from Agra " )
( train_bengalifemale_04143 " He presented a beautiful carved marble bouquet of flowers The Emperor was very happy to see it and gave him one thousand gold coins " )
( train_bengalifemale_04144 " Just then a boy came and presented the Emperor a beautiful bouquet of real flowers " )
( train_bengalifemale_04145 " The Emperor was very happy to see it too so he gave a silver coin to the boy " )
( train_bengalifemale_04146 " Birbal said So the carving was more beautiful than the real thing " )
( train_bengalifemale_04147 " Akbar understood that he had fallen in the hands of his witty minister once again " )
( train_bengalifemale_04148 " One day Akbar stumbled on a rock in his garden while taking a stroll " )
( train_bengalifemale_04149 " He was not in a good mood already and then this fall " )
( train_bengalifemale_04150 " He got very angry and ordered for the gardener's arrest and execution " )
( train_bengalifemale_04151 " The next day at the time of execution the gardener was asked what his last wish was " )
( train_bengalifemale_04152 " He requested for an audience with the Emperor and His wish was granted and he was brought in the Court " )
( train_bengalifemale_04153 " When he came near the throne he loudly cleared the throat and spat at the feet of the Emperor " )
( train_bengalifemale_04154 " The Emperor demanded to know why did he do such a thing " )
( train_bengalifemale_04155 " The gardener did this on Birbal's advice so Birbal stepped forward in the gardener's defense " )
( train_bengalifemale_04156 " He said There could be no person more loyal than this unfortunate gardener " )
( train_bengalifemale_04157 " Fearing that you ordered him for hanging for a small reason he went out of his way to give you a genuine reason for ordering him to be hanged " )
( train_bengalifemale_04158 " One day Birbal happened to pass a harmless comment on Akbar's sense of humor but Akbar was no fool " )
( train_bengalifemale_04159 " He got very angry with Birbal and ordered him to not only leave the court but also the city of Agra his capital " )
( train_bengalifemale_04160 " Birbal was terribly hurt but could not do anything about it So Birbal left " )
( train_bengalifemale_04161 " But then Akbar was missing him and wanted him back in the Court " )
( train_bengalifemale_04162 " He could not do anything without him because he didn't know his whereabouts and nobody else also knew where he was " )
( train_bengalifemale_04163 " One day an intelligent saint came to his court and told him the way to search for him " )
( train_bengalifemale_04164 " Now Akbar did as the saint said to him and announced that he will give one thousand gold coins whosoever will come to his Court in half Sun and in half shade " )
( train_bengalifemale_04165 " Next day a villager came carrying a string cot over his head and claimed the money " )
( train_bengalifemale_04166 " He said I am in half sun and in half shade Akbar understood that this man cannot do it himself " )
( train_bengalifemale_04167 " On interrogation he confessed that Birbal suggested him this plan " )
( train_bengalifemale_04168 " Akbar was very happy to hear this He asked him the whereabouts of Birbal and immediately ordered him to come back to his court and they had a happy reunion " )
( train_bengalifemale_04169 " Once Birbal was invited for lunch by a rich man Birbal went to the man's house and found him in a hall full of people where his host greeted him warmly " )
( train_bengalifemale_04170 " I did not know there would be so many guests said Birbal who hated large gatherings " )
( train_bengalifemale_04171 " They are not guests said the man They are my employees all except one man who is the only other guest here beside you " )
( train_bengalifemale_04172 " Then a crafty look came on the man's face and he asked Can you tell me which of them is the guest " )
( train_bengalifemale_04173 " Maybe I could said Birbal Talk to them as I observe them Tell them a joke or something " )
( train_bengalifemale_04174 " The man told a joke that Birbal thought was perhaps the worst he had heard in a long time " )
( train_bengalifemale_04175 " When he finished everyone laughed uproariously " )
( train_bengalifemale_04176 " Well said the rich man I have told my joke now tell me who my other guest is " )
( train_bengalifemale_04177 " Birbal pointed out the man to him at which his host was amazed and asked How did you know " )
( train_bengalifemale_04178 " Employees tend to laugh at any joke told by their employers explained Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04179 " Birbal was in Persia at the invitation of the king of that country " )
( train_bengalifemale_04180 " Parties were given in his honour and rich presents were heaped on him " )
( train_bengalifemale_04181 " On the eve of his departure for home a nobleman asked him how he would compare the king of Persia to his own king " )
( train_bengalifemale_04182 " Your king is a full moon whereas mine could be likened to the quarter moon said Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04183 " The Persians were very happy but when Birbal got home he found that Emperor Akbar was furious with him " )
( train_bengalifemale_04184 " How could you belittle your own king demanded Akbar You are a traitor " )
( train_bengalifemale_04185 " No Your Majesty I did not belittle you said Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04186 " The full moon diminishes and disappears whereas the quarter moon grows from strength to strength " )
( train_bengalifemale_04187 " What I in fact proclaimed to the world is that your power is growing from day to day whereas that of the king of Persia is about to go into decline " )
( train_bengalifemale_04188 " Akbar grunted in satisfaction and welcomed back Birbal with a warm embrace " )
( train_bengalifemale_04189 " One fine day Emperor Akbar was discussing about the vegetable brinjal with Birbal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04190 " He told him what a delicious and nutritious vegetable it was " )
( train_bengalifemale_04191 " Much to Akbar's surprise Birbal thoroughly agreed with him and even sang two songs in praise of the humble brinjal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04192 " After a couple of days the royal chef cooked brinjal curry for lunch and Birbal was also eating at the palace that day " )
( train_bengalifemale_04193 " But Birbal too refused it saying that it was not good for health " )
( train_bengalifemale_04194 " So Akbar impatiently asked him why he was saying such things when he sang the brinjals praise not a few days ago " )
( train_bengalifemale_04195 " Birbal replied that he had praised the brinjal only because his emperor had praised it and criticized it when his majesty had criticized it as he was loyal to his emperor and to not the brinjal " )
( train_bengalifemale_04196 " He said that the brinjal could not make him a minister no matter how much he praised it " )
( train_bengalifemale_04197 " The emperor was pleased by his honest bold and witty response " )
